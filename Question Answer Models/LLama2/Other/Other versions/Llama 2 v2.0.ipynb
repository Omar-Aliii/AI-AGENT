              " 'context': ['Synergistic loss of prostate cancer cell viability by coinhibition of HDAC and PARP. UNLABELLED: Tumors with BRCA germline mutations are defective in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) through homologous recombination (HR) pathways, making them sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). However, BRCA germline mutations are rare in prostate cancer limiting the ability to therapeutically target these pathways. This study investigates whether histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi), reported to modulate DSB repair pathways in sporadic cancers, can downregulate DSB repair pathways and sensitize prostate cancer cells to PARPi. Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index < 0.9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not. Similarly, clonogenicity was significantly decreased after cotreatment. Flow cytometric cell-cycle analysis and Annexin-V staining revealed significant apoptosis upon treatment with SAHA+olaparib. This coincided with increased DNA damage observed by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of γH2AX foci, a marker of DSBs. In addition, immunoblot analysis showed a significant and persistent increase in nuclear γH2AX levels. Both SAHA and olaparib downregulated the expression of HR-related proteins, BRCA1 and RAD51, whereas SAHA + olaparib had an additive effect on RAD51. Silencing RAD51 sensitized prostate cancer cells to SAHA and olaparib alone. Collectively, cotreatment with HDACi and PARPi downregulated HR-related protein expression and concomitantly increased DNA damage, resulting in prostate cancer cell death. IMPLICATIONS: These findings provide a strong rationale for supporting the use of combined HDAC and PARP inhibition in treating advanced prostate cancer.',\n",
              "  'Thyroid morphology and subclinical hypothyroidism in children and adolescents with Williams syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To verify the prevalence of morpho-volumetric and functional thyroid abnormalities in young patients with Williams syndrome (WS). STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-two patients with WS (49 boys and 43 girls, 0.2-17.2 years of age) underwent evaluation of thyroid function by means of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), fT3, and fT4 measurement. Thyroid ultrasonography was performed in 37 patients. Thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin) were measured in all patients with abnormal thyroid function tests. RESULTS: None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid antibodies were absent in all patients. The prevalence of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly higher in the younger patients. Ultrasonography revealed morphological or volumetric abnormalities of the thyroid gland in 67.5% of patients; these abnormalities were more frequently observed in the older children. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either with normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function. Therefore, we suggest yearly monitoring of thyroid function and sonographic studies at least once in patients with WS. Treatment should be reserved for the patients with overt hypothyroidism or for those whose thyroid function shows signs of progressive deterioration.',\n",
              "  'Upregulated MALAT-1 contributes to bladder cancer cell migration by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Recent studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA MALAT-1 expression is upregulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study we evaluated MALAT-1 expression in bladder cancer tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its biological functions. We verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1 expression was remarkably increased in primary tumors that subsequently metastasized, when compared to those primary tumors that did not metastasize. SiRNA-mediated MALAT-1 silencing impaired in vitro bladder cancer cell migration. Downregulation of MALAT-1 resulted in a decrease of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated ZEB1, ZEB2 and Slug levels, and an increase of E-cadherin levels. We further demonstrated that MALAT-1 promoted EMT by activating Wnt signaling in vitro. These data suggest an important role for MALAT-1 in regulating metastasis of bladder cancer and the potential application of MALAT-1 in bladder cancer therapy.',\n",
              "  \"Novel insights into the regulation of antioxidant-response-element-mediated gene expression by electrophiles: induction of the transcriptional repressor BACH1 by Nrf2. A central mechanism in cellular defence against oxidative or electrophilic stress is mediated by transcriptional induction of genes via the ARE (antioxidant-response element), a cis-acting sequence present in the regulatory regions of genes involved in the detoxification and elimination of reactive oxidants and electrophiles. The ARE binds different bZIP (basic-region leucine zipper) transcription factors, most notably Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2) that functions as a transcriptional activator via heterodimerization with small Maf proteins. Although ARE activation by Nrf2 is relatively well understood, the mechanisms by which ARE-mediated signalling is down-regulated are poorly known. Transcription factor BACH1 [BTB (broad-complex, tramtrack and bric-a-brac) and CNC (cap'n'collar protein) homology 1] binds to ARE-like sequences, functioning as a transcriptional repressor in a subset of ARE-regulated genes, thus antagonizing the activator function of Nrf2. In the present study, we have demonstrated that BACH1 itself is regulated by Nrf2 as it is induced by Nrf2 overexpression and by Nrf2-activating agents in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Furthermore, a functional ARE site was identified at +1411 from the transcription start site of transcript variant 2 of BACH1. We conclude that BACH1 is a bona fide Nrf2 target gene and that induction of BACH1 by Nrf2 may serve as a feedback-inhibitory mechanism for ARE-mediated gene regulation.\",\n",
              "  '[Dermatitis herpetiformis occuring in patients with celiac disease in childhood]. BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic papulovesicular immune-mediated disorder associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. We report eight cases in which DH appeared many years after celiac disease (CD) in child. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of CD was based on histological features of total or subtotal villous atrophy, full remission after withdrawal of gluten from the diet, and eventually circulating antibodies (IgA gliadin, antireticulin and antiendomysium) at the time of diagnosis and their disappearance under gluten-free diet. The diagnosis of DH was made from clinical findings, histological examination of the involved skin and direct immunofluorescence microscopy of normal or perilesional skin. HLA class II typing was performed in five patients. DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DBP1 alleles were studied. RESULTS: DH appeared between 3 and 22 years after the initial diagnosis of CD. Five patients did not show at that time any digestive symptoms. In three cases, a break in the gluten-free diet or a recent revival of the normal diet preceded the rash. In only one case, DH appeared while the patient was under gluten-free diet. In three patients, the rash appeared many years after the gluten-free diet had been stopped. Phenotype DR3 and/or DR7 of the celiac disease could be found in four of the five patients studied; three of them were found to bear DQW2. The DR2 allele was not found in any of the five tested patients. DISCUSSION: These eight cases illustrate the absence of precise nosological barrier between gluten-sensitive enteropathy of the DH and that observed in CD. The presence of the DR7 allele, and especially the absence of the DR2 allele, could explain the particularly severe and symptomatic course of the enteropathy in these patients. The delay in the appearance of DH, after a very variable period of normal diet, could correspond to the necessary time for progressive accumulation of IgA (or immune complex IgA-gluten) in the skin after a digestive sensitization to gluten. The preventive role of gluten-free diet is thus probable. CONCLUSION: CD and DH likely correspond to two different stages of the same disease, thus requiring a prolonged follow-up of both digestive and skin tissues. Long-term eviction of gluten to prevent eventual DH must be balanced with the demand and the cost of such a diet.',\n",
              "  'A new procedure for extraction of collagen from modern and archaeological bones for 14C dating. Bones are potentially the best age indicators in a stratigraphic study, because they are closely related to the layer in which they are found. Collagen is the most suitable fraction and is the material normally used in radiocarbon dating. Bone contaminants can strongly alter the carbon isotopic fraction values of the samples, so chemical pretreatment for (14)C dating by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is essential. The most widespread method for collagen extraction is based on the Longin procedure, which consists in HCl demineralization to dissolve the inorganic phase of the samples, followed by dissolution of collagen in a weak acid solution. In this work the possible side effects of this procedure on a modern bone are presented; the extracted collagen was analyzed by ATR-IR spectroscopy. An alternative procedure, based on use of HF instead of HCl, to minimize unwanted degradation of the organic fraction, is also given. A study by ATR-IR spectroscopic analysis of collagen collected after different demineralization times and with different acid volumes, and a study of an archaeological sample, are also presented.',\n",

              "  \"Molecular characterization of the breakpoints of a 12-kb deletion in the NF1 gene in a family showing germ-line mosaicism. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by deletions, insertions, translocations, and point mutations in the NF1 gene, which spans 350 kb on the long arm of human chromosome 17. Although several point mutations have been described, large molecular abnormalities have rarely been characterized in detail. We describe here the molecular breakpoints of a 12-kb deletion of the NF1 gene, which is responsible for the NF1 phenotype in a kindred with two children affected because of germline mosaicism in the unaffected father, who has the mutation in 10% of his spermatozoa. The mutation spans introns 31-39, removing 12,021 nt and inserting 30 bp, of which 19 bp are a direct repetition of a sequence located in intron 31, just 4 bp before the 5' breakpoint. The 5' and 3' breakpoints contain the sequence TATTTTA, which could be involved in the generation of the deletion. The most plausible explanation for the mechanism involved in the generation of this 12-kb deletion is homologous/nonhomologous recombination. Since sperm of the father does not contain the corresponding insertion of the 12-kb deleted sequence, this deletion could have occurred within the NF1 chromosome through loop formation. RNA from lymphocytes of one of the NF1 patients showed similar levels of the mutated and normal transcripts, suggesting that the NF1-mRNA from mutations causing frame shifts of the reading frame or stop codons in this gene is not degraded during its processing. The mutation was not detected in fresh lymphocytes from the unaffected father by PCR analysis, supporting the case for true germ-line mosaicism.\",\n",
              "  'The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are rare drug-resistant cancer cell subsets proposed to be responsible for the maintenance and recurrence of cancer and metastasis. Telomerase is constitutively active in both bulk tumor cell and CSC populations but has only limited expression in normal tissues. Thus, inhibition of telomerase has been shown to be a viable approach in controlling cancer growth in nonclinical studies and is currently in phase II clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited. Additionally, imetelstat treatment reduced the CSC fractions present in the breast and pancreatic cell lines. In vitro treatment with imetelstat, but not control oligonucleotides, also reduced the proliferation and self-renewal potential of MCF7 mammospheres and resulted in cell death after <4 weeks of treatment. In vitro treatment of PANC1 cells showed reduced tumor engraftment in nude mice, concomitant with a reduction in the CSC levels. Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations. Our results suggest that imetelstat-mediated depletion of CSCs may offer an alternative mechanism by which telomerase inhibition may be exploited for cancer therapy.',\n",
              "  'Poly(A) tail length is controlled by the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein regulating the interaction between poly(A) polymerase and the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. Poly(A) tails of mRNAs are synthesized in the cell nucleus with a defined length, approximately 250 nucleotides in mammalian cells. The same type of length control is seen in an in vitro polyadenylation system reconstituted from three proteins: poly(A) polymerase, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), and the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1). CPSF, binding the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA, and PABPN1, binding the growing poly(A) tail, cooperatively stimulate poly(A) polymerase such that a complete poly(A) tail is synthesized in one processive event, which terminates at a length of approximately 250 nucleotides. We report that PABPN1 is required to restrict CPSF binding to the AAUAAA sequence and to permit the stimulation of poly(A) polymerase by AAUAAA-bound CPSF to be maintained throughout the elongation reaction. The stimulation by CPSF is disrupted when the poly(A) tail has reached a length of approximately 250 nucleotides, and this terminates processive elongation. PABPN1 measures the length of the tail and is responsible for disrupting the CPSF-poly(A) polymerase interaction.',\n",

To assess neurological impairments quantitatively in an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), we have used a targeted model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which leads to the formation of anatomically defined lesions in the spinal cord. Deficits in the hindlimb locomotion are therefore well defined and highly reproducible, in contrast to the situation in generalized EAE with disseminated lesions. Behavioral tests for hindlimb sensorimotor functions, originally established for traumatic spinal cord injury, revealed temporary or persistent deficits in open field locomotion, the grid walk, the narrow beam and the measurement of the foot exorotation angle. Such refined behavioral testing in EAE will be crucial for the analysis of new therapeutic approaches for MS that seek to improve or prevent neurological impairment.',\n",
              "  'Phospholamban interacts with HAX-1, a mitochondrial protein with anti-apoptotic function. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart. Its regulatory effects are mediated through its interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, (SERCA2a), resulting in alterations of its Ca(2+)-affinity. To identify additional proteins that may interact with PLN, we used the yeast-two-hybrid system to screen an adult human cardiac cDNA library. HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a PLN-binding partner. The minimal binding regions were mapped to amino acid residues 203-245 for HAX-1 and residues 16-22 for PLN. The interaction between the two proteins was confirmed using GST-HAX-1, bound to the glutathione-matrix, which specifically adsorbed native PLN from human or mouse cardiac homogenates, while in reciprocal binding studies, recombinant His-HAX-1 bound GST-PLN. Kinetic studies using surface plasmon resonance yielded a K(D) of approximately 1 muM as the binding affinity for the PLN/HAX-1 complex. Phosphorylation of PLN by cAMP-dependent protein kinase reduced binding to HAX-1, while increasing concentrations of Ca(2+) diminished the PLN/HAX-1 interaction in a dose-dependent manner. HAX-1 concentrated to mitochondria, but upon transient co-transfection of HEK 293 cells with PLN, HAX-1 redistributed and co-localized with PLN at the endoplasmic reticulum. Analysis of the anti-apoptotic function of HAX-1 revealed that the presence of PLN enhanced the HAX-1 protective effects from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death. These findings suggest a possible link between the Ca(2+) handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cell survival mediated by the PLN/HAX-1 interaction.',\n",

Netherton syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 encoding the Kazal-type inhibitor LEKTI-1 leading to dysregulation of proteolytic cascades involving several kallikreins. We used both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening computations to identify commercially available non-covalent inhibitors of human kallikrein 5 (hK5), a serine protease (trypsin-like) that plays a central role in the initiation of the molecular cascades leading to the Netherton syndrome phenotype. The efficacy and mechanism of inhibition of the identified new families of organic compounds were analyzed not only for hK5 but also on other proteases implicated in the cascades (hK7, hK14 and matriptase). These inhibitors are nontoxic on healthy human keratinocytes and are structurally different from traditional serine protease inhibitors validating their potential utility as initial hits to control proteolytic disorders observed in dermatological pathologies such as Netherton syndrome.',\n",
              "  'The anthrax toxin activator gene atxA is associated with CO2-enhanced non-toxin gene expression in Bacillus anthracis. The Bacillus anthracis toxin genes, cya, lef, and pag, can be viewed as a regulon, in which transcription of all three genes is activated in trans by the same regulatory gene, atxA, in response to the same signal, CO2. In atxA+ strains, toxin gene expression is increased 5- to 20-fold in cells grown in 5% CO2 relative to cells grown in air. CO2-enhanced toxin gene transcription is not observed in atx4-null mutants. Here, we used two independent techniques to obtain evidence for additional CO2-induced atxA-regulated genes. First, total protein preparations from atxA4+ and atxA isolates grown in 5% CO2 and in air were examined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Comparison of the resulting protein patterns indicated that synthesis of non-toxin proteins is influenced by growth in elevated CO2 and the toxin gene regulator, atxA. Second, we generated random transcriptional lacZ fusions in B. anthracis with transposon Tn917-LTV3. Transposon-insertion libraries were screened for mutants expressing CO2-enhanced atxA-dependent beta-galactosidase activity. DNA sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites in 17 mutants carrying CO2- and atxA-regulated fusions revealed 10 mutants carrying independent insertions on the 185-kb toxin plasmid pXO1 which did not map to the toxin genes. The tcr-lacZ fusion mutants (tcr for toxin coregulated) were Tox+, indicating that these genes may not be involved in anthrax toxin gene activation. Our data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B. anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins.',\n",
              "  'Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Safe and effective stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial as the number of patients with this condition continues to increase. Several novel oral anticoagulants are being developed as replacements for warfarin for this indication. Direct factor Xa inhibitors comprise the largest class of oral anticoagulants in development; the inhibition of factor Xa is recognized to be a promising target for therapeutic anticoagulation, partly because of its location in the coagulation cascade. Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the active site of factor Xa. Their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles vary, which might allow patient-specific therapy. Several of these agents have been tested in clinical trials for various indications, including AF, with favorable results. In particular, apixaban and rivaroxaban have shown superiority and noninferiority, respectively, to warfarin in phase III clinical trials for stroke prevention in AF. These agents have also been shown to be safe in terms of bleeding risk. Despite these advantages, factor Xa inhibitors have several characteristics, such as potential interactions with other drugs (inhibitors of cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein) and the inability to reverse their anticoagulant effects, as well as concerns about poor patient compliance, which must be considered when initiating patients on a novel factor Xa inhibitor.',\n",
              "  'Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of opicapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, in healthy subjects: prediction of slow enzyme-inhibitor complex dissociation of a short-living and very long-acting inhibitor. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opicapone is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (including the effect of food) and pharmacodynamics (effect on COMT activity) following single oral doses of opicapone in young healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Single rising oral doses of opicapone (10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,200 mg) were administered to eight groups of eight subjects per group (two subjects randomized to placebo and six subjects to opicapone), under a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. In an additional group of 12 subjects, a 50 mg single dose of opicapone was administered on two occasions, once having fasted overnight and once with a high-fat high-calorie meal. RESULTS: Opicapone was well tolerated at all doses tested. The extent of systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration) to opicapone and metabolites increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner and showed a decrease following concomitant ingestion of a high-fat high-calorie meal. The apparent terminal elimination half-life of opicapone was 0.8-3.2 h. Sulphation appeared to be the main metabolic pathway for opicapone, and both opicapone and the main sulphated metabolite are likely excreted by the biliary route. Maximum COMT inhibition by opicapone was dose dependent, ranged from 36.1% (10 mg) to 100% (200 mg and above), and reached statistical significance at all doses tested. The long duration of COMT inhibition by opicapone, however, tended to be independent from the dose taken. The observed half-life of opicapone-induced COMT inhibition in human erythrocytes was 61.6 h (standard deviation [SD] = 37.6 h), which reflects an underlying dissociative process with a kinetic rate constant of 3.1 × 10(-6) s(-1) (SD = 1.9 × 10(-6) s(-1)). Such a process compares well to the estimated dissociation rate constant (k(off)) of the COMT-opicapone molecular complex (k(off) = 1.9 × 10(-6) s(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone was well-tolerated and presented dose-proportional kinetics. Opicapone demonstrated marked and sustained inhibition of erythrocyte soluble COMT activity. Based on the observation that the half-life of COMT inhibition is independent of the dose and that it reflects an underlying kinetic process that is consistent with the k(off) value of the COMT-opicapone complex, we propose that the sustained COMT inhibition, far beyond the observable point of clearance of circulating drug, is due to the long residence time of the reversible complex formed between COMT and opicapone. Globally, these promising results provide a basis for further clinical development of opicapone.',\n",

We examined the modulatory effect of JTV-519 on the antitumor activity of several platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin, and nedaplatin) in a human cancer cell line resistant to cisplatin (PC-14 / CDDP) in vitro. PC-14 / CDDP cells showed 8-fold resistance to cisplatin compared with the parental PC-14 cells as determined by dye formation [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTT] assay. In PC-14 / CDDP, but not PC-14 cells, augmentation of cytotoxicity was observed when a nontoxic concentration (10 mM) of JTV-519 was combined with the platinum compounds. Increased intracellular cisplatin accumulation was observed in PC-14 / CDDP cells in the presence of JTV-519 as measured by atomic absorption assay. Therefore, increased cisplatin accumulation was considered to be a possible mechanism underlying the reversing effect of JTV-519 on cisplatin resistance. These results suggest that JTV-519 is a potent agent reversing cisplatin resistance.',\n",

Bacterial pathogens commonly associated with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete Treponema denticola and the Gram-negative, proteolytic species Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. These species rely on complex anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug oxantel has been shown to inhibit fumarate reductase (Frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit P. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. Here, we demonstrate that oxantel inhibited P. gingivalis Frd activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.2 μM and planktonic growth of T. forsythia with a MIC of 295 μM, but it had no effect on the growth of T. denticola. Oxantel treatment caused the downregulation of six P. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. All of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. There was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that P. gingivalis may be unable to overcome Frd inhibition. Oxantel disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. In these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree, demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of T. denticola on the other two species. In a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis oxantel addition to the drinking water of P. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.',\n",

Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities. However, little is known about the regulation of HO-1 in human primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Here we investigated the expression of HO-1 in primary and established AML cells as well as other types of leukemic cells and normal monocytes, and its regulatory mechanism by the transcriptional repressor, BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1), and the activator, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). Leukemic cell lines such as U937 expressed little HO-1, whereas most freshly isolated AML cells and monocytes expressed substantial amounts of HO-1, along with Bach1 and Nrf2. When U937 cells were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PHA) or gamma-interferon, they significantly expressed both HO-1 and Bach1, like primary AML cells. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced HO-1 expression in U937 cells but suppressed it in primary monocytes and PMA-treated U937 cells. In HO-1-expressing cells, Bach1 was localized in the cytoplasm, but Nrf2 was localized in the nuclei. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay of these cells revealed the preferential binding of Nrf2 over Bach1 to Maf-recognition elements, the enhancer regions of the HO-1 gene. The downregulation of the HO-1 gene with siRNA increased a cytotoxic effect of an anticancer drug on primary AML cells, whereas the downregulation of Bach1 increased HO-1 expression, leading to enhanced survival. These and other results show that Bach1 plays a critical role in regulating HO-1 gene expression in AML cells and its expression suppresses their survival by downregulating HO-1 expression. Thus, functional upregulation of Bach1 is a potential strategy for antileukemic therapy.',\n",

RESULTS: In women the DAS28 was significantly higher than in men due to higher scores for general health and tender joints. Likewise, HAQ and VAS pain were rated significantly higher in women. The SOFI score was worse in men during the first 2 years, depending on higher upper limb scores. Total Sharp score (TotSharp), erosion score and joint space narrowing score did not differ between the sexes at any time point. The DAS28 area under the curve (AUC) correlated significantly with TotSharp at 5 years in both genders (r = 0.316, r = 0.313) mainly owing to swollen joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The SOFI AUC correlated significantly with TotSharp in women (r = 0.135 to 0.220) but not in men. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a similar degree of radiographic joint destruction women had, compared with men, worse scores for DAS28 and HAQ, possibly due to higher pain perception and less muscular strength and perhaps because men overestimate their functional capacity.',\n",
              "  \"Selexipag: an oral, selective prostacyclin receptor agonist for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In this phase 2 proof-of-concept study we examined the safety and efficacy of selexipag, an orally available, selective prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonist, as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 43 adult patients with symptomatic PAH (receiving stable endothelin receptor antagonist and/or a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor therapy) were randomised three to one to receive either selexipag or placebo. Dosage was up-titrated in 200-μg increments from 200 μg twice daily on day 1 to the maximum tolerated dose by day 35 (maximum allowed dose of 800 μg twice daily). Change in pulmonary vascular resistance at week 17 expressed as a percentage of the baseline value was the primary efficacy end-point, and was analysed in the per protocol set first and then in the all-treated set to assess robustness of results. A statistically significant 30.3% reduction in geometric mean pulmonary vascular resistance was observed after 17 weeks' treatment with selexipag compared with placebo (95% confidence limits -44.7- -12.2; p=0.0045, Wilcoxon rank sum test). This was supported by a similar result from the all-treated set. Selexipag was well tolerated with a safety profile in line with the expected pharmacological effect. Our results encourage the further investigation of selexipag for the treatment of PAH.\",\n",
              "  \"SEA0400, a specific Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor, prevents dopaminergic neurotoxicity in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We have recently shown that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced cytotoxicity in cultured astrocytes and neurons. However, there is no in vivo evidence suggesting the role of NCX in neurodegenerative disorders associated with NO. NO is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. This study examined the effect of SEA0400, the specific NCX inhibitor, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, a model of Parkinson's disease, in C57BL/6J mice. MPTP treatment (10 mg/kg, four times at 2-h intervals) decreased dopamine levels in the midbrain and impaired motor coordination, and these effects were counteracted by S-methylthiocitrulline, a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor. SEA0400 protected against the dopaminergic neurotoxicity (determined by dopamine levels in the midbrain and striatum, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra and striatum, striatal dopamine release, and motor deficits) in MPTP-treated mice. SEA0400 had no radical-scavenging activity. SEA0400 did not affect MPTP metabolism and MPTP-induced NO production and microglial activation, while it attenuated MPTP-induced increases in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation product, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance. These findings suggest that SEA0400 protects against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity probably by blocking ERK phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation which are downstream of NCX-mediated Ca(2+) influx.\",\n",
              "  'Phenylpropanoid glycosides from plant cell cultures induce heme oxygenase 1 gene expression in a human keratinocyte cell line by affecting the balance of NRF2 and BACH1 transcription factors. Phenylpropanoids have several highly significant biological properties in both plants and animals. Four phenylpropanoid glycosides (PPGs), verbascoside (VB), forsythoside B (FB), echinacoside (EC) and campneoside I (CP), were purified and tested for their capability to activate NRF2 and induce phase II cytoprotective enzymes in a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). All four substances showed similar strong antioxidant and radical-scavenging activities as determined by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl assay. Furthermore, in HaCaT cells, FB and EC are strong activators of NRF2, the nuclear transcription factor regulating many phase II detoxifying and cytoprotective enzymes, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1). In HaCaT cells, FB and EC (200 μM) induced nuclear translocation of NRF2 protein after 24 h and reduced nuclear protein levels of BACH1, a repressor of the antioxidant response element. FB and EC greatly HMOX1 mRNA levels by more than 40-fold in 72 h. Cytoplasmic HMOX1 protein levels were also increased at 48 h after treatment. VB was less active compared to FB and EC, and CP was slightly active only at later times of treatment. We suggest that hydroxytyrosol (HYD) could be a potential bioactive metabolite of PPGs since HYD, in equimolar amounts to PGGs, is able to both activate HO-1 transcription and modify Nrf2/Bach1 nuclear protein levels. This is in agreement with the poor activity of CP, which contains a HYD moiety modified by an O-methyl group. In conclusion, FB and EC from plant cell cultures may provide long-lasting skin protection by induction of phase II cytoprotective capabilities.',\n",
              "  'A novel mutation in the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6 (SLC9A6) causes Christianson syndrome with electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES). Mutations in the solute carrier family 9, subfamily A member 6 (SLC9A6) gene, encoding the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6) are associated with Christianson syndrome, a syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability characterized by microcephaly, severe global developmental delay, autistic behavior, early onset seizures and ataxia. In a 7-year-old boy with characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features of Christianson syndrome and epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep, we identified a novel splice site mutation (IVS10-1G>A) in SLC9A6. These findings expand the clinical spectrum of the syndrome and indicate NHE6 dysfunction as a new cause of electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES).',\n",
              "  'Further delineation of the phenotype resulting from BRAF or MEK1 germline mutations helps differentiate cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome from Costello syndrome. Because Cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome has significant phenotypic overlap with Costello syndrome, it may be difficult to establish the diagnosis on a clinical basis. The recent discoveries of germline HRAS mutations in patients with Costello syndrome and mutations in BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 in CFC syndrome uncovered the biologic mechanism for the shared phenotypic findings based on the close interaction of the affected gene products within the MAP kinase pathway. We evaluated a series of patients who were either clinically diagnosed with Costello syndrome, or in whom the diagnoses of both Costello and CFC syndromes were considered. After excluding mutations in HRAS, we identified eight changes in BRAF and five in MEK1. Five mutations are novel, and all changes occurred de novo among those triads tested. A review of the clinical abnormalities showed important differences between patients with either a BRAF or MEK1 mutation, and those previously reported with an HRAS mutation. Statistical significance was achieved, despite the relatively small number of patients with BRAF and MEK1 mutations reported here, for polyhydramnios, growth hormone deficiency and the presence of more than one papilloma, which were less common in CFC compared to HRAS mutation positive patients. Although both CFC and Costello syndrome are characterized by cardiac abnormalities in about three-fourths of patients, the pattern of congenital heart defects (CHD), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and tachycardia differs somewhat. CHD, especially pulmonic stenosis associated with a secundum-type atrial septal defect, are more common in CFC than Costello syndrome (P = 0.02). Atrial tachycardia is less frequent in CFC patients with BRAF or MEK1 mutations, compared to Costello syndrome patients with HRAS mutation (P = 0.04). Chaotic atrial rhythm or multifocal atrial tachycardia was observed only in Costello syndrome. Malignant tumors have been viewed as characteristic for Costello syndrome due to HRAS mutations, however, we report here on a MEK1 mutation in a patient with a malignant tumor, a hepatoblastoma. Although this indicates that the presence of a tumor is not specific for Costello syndrome with HRAS mutation, it is noteworthy that the tumor histology differs from those commonly seen in Costello syndrome. Based on these clinical differences we suggest that patients with BRAF and MEK mutations should be diagnosed with CFC syndrome, and the diagnosis of Costello syndrome be reserved for patients with HRAS mutations.',\n",
              "  'Oligomeric interactions between phospholamban molecules regulate Ca-ATPase activity in functionally reconstituted membranes. Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of Ca-ATPase transport activity. To identify whether oligomeric interactions between PLB molecules are involved in regulating Ca-ATPase transport activity, we have investigated functional interactions between PLB and the Ca-ATPase in proteoliposomes of purified PLB functionally co-reconstituted with the SERCA2a isoform of the Ca-ATPase isolated from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The calcium sensitivity of this reconstituted preparation and functional stimulation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are virtually identical to those of the Ca-ATPase in cardiac SR microsomes, ensuring the functional relevance of this reconstituted preparation. Interactions between PLB molecules were measured following covalent modification of the single lysine (i.e., Lys(3)) in PLB isolated from cardiac SR membranes with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) prior to co-reconstitution with the Ca-ATPase. FITC modification of PLB does not interfere with the ability of PLB to inhibit the Ca-ATPase, since FITC-PLB co-reconstituted with the Ca-ATPase exhibits a similar calcium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation to that observed in native SR membranes. Thus, the functional arrangement of PLB with the Ca-ATPase is not modified by FITC modification. Using changes in the anisotropy of FITC-PLB resulting from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between proximal PLB molecules to measure the average size and spatial arrangement of FITC chromophores, we find that PLB self-associates to form oligomers whose spatial arrangement with respect to one another is in agreement with earlier suggestions that PLB exists predominantly as a homopentamer. The inability of PKA to activate PLB following covalent modification with FITC permits functional interactions between PLB molecules associated with the Ca-ATPase activation to be identified. A second-order loss of Ca-ATPase activation by PKA is observed as a function of the fractional contribution of FITC-PLB, indicating that PKA-dependent activation of two PLB molecules within a quaternary complex containing the Ca-ATPase is necessary for activation of the Ca-ATPase. We suggest that the requirement for activation of two PLB molecules by PKA represents a physiological mechanism to ensure that activation of the Ca-ATPase following beta-adrenergic stimulation in the heart only occurs above a threshold level of PKA activation.',\n",

              "  \"The emergence of factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases: a patent review. INTRODUCTION: Factor Xa (FXa) is a critical enzyme in the coagulation cascade responsible for thrombin generation, the final enzyme that leads to fibrin clot formation. Significant success has recently been reported with compounds such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and more recently in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). The success these agents have demonstrated is now being reflected by a narrowing of new FXa patents over the past few years. The new patents appear to be structural modifications of previously published, small molecule inhibitors and bind in a similar manner to the FXa enzyme. AREAS COVERED: SciFinder®, PubMed and Google websites were used as the main source of literature retrieval. Patent searches were conducted in the patent databases: HCAPlus, WPIX and the full text databases (USPAT2, USPATFULL, EPFULL, PCTFULL) using the following keywords: ((FXa) OR (F OR factor) (W) (Xa)) (S) (inhibit? or block? or modulat? or antagonist? or regulat?). The search was restricted to patent documents with the entry date on or after 1 January 2009. Literature and information related to clinical development was retrieved from Thomson Reuter's Pharma. EXPERT OPINION: A large body of Phase II and Phase III data is now available for FXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. The clinical data demonstrate favorable benefit-risk profiles compared with the standards of care for short- and long-term anticoagulation (i.e., low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and wafarin). The potential exists that these agents will eventually be the agents of choice for the treatment of a host of cardiovascular disease states, offering improved efficacy, safety, and ease of use compared with existing anticoagulants.\",\n",
              "  'Psoriasin (S100A7) increases the expression of ROS and VEGF and acts through RAGE to promote endothelial cell proliferation. Psoriasin (S100A7), originally identified in psoriasis, is a calcium-binding protein belonging to the multigenic S100 family. In high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, psoriasin was identified as one of the most abundant transcripts. We have previously shown that psoriasin was induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, the downregulation of psoriasin by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to the reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether psoriasin could have direct effects on endothelial cells. In this study we demonstrated that psoriasin increased VEGF expression in mammary epithelial cells. The treatment of endothelial cells with recombinant psoriasin increased proliferation comparable to that of recombinant VEGF protein. No change in proliferation was seen when endothelial cells were infected with psoriasin-expressing adenoviruses, suggesting that the proliferative effect of psoriasin was mediated by a specific receptor. Treatment with sRAGE, targeting the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), thus inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation enhanced by recombinant psoriasin. We showed that VEGF expression was not induced by hydrogen peroxide, when psoriasin was silenced by shRNA, which led to the hypothesis that psoriasin induces ROS. Indeed, psoriasin was shown to induce ROS in both endothelial and epithelial cells. Moreover, sRAGE inhibited the psoriasin-dependent generation of ROS in endothelial cells. Finally, treatment with antioxidant Bcl-2 protein abolished the effect of psoriasin on endothelial cell proliferation. Our data suggest that psoriasin expression in mammary epithelial cells leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation in a paracrine manner through RAGE. Psoriasin may therefore play a role in breast cancer progression by promoting oxidative stress response and angiogenesis.',\n",
              "  'Tolerance to oats in dermatitis herpetiformis. OBJECTIVES: Recent studies on coeliac disease have shown that oats can be included in a gluten-free diet without adverse effects on the small bowel. The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats. PATIENTS/METHODS: Eleven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in remission on a gluten-free diet were challenged daily with 50 g oats for six months. Clinical symptoms were recorded, serum samples taken, and skin and small bowel biopsies performed before and after the oat challenge. A control group comprised of 11 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a conventional gluten-free diet was also studied. RESULTS: Eight patients challenged with oats remained asymptomatic, two developed a transient rash, and one withdrew because of the appearance of a more persistent but mild rash. Three of the 11 controls also developed a transient rash. IgA endomysial antibodies remained negative in all patients. The small bowel villous architecture, the densities of intraepithelial CD3 and alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cell receptor positive lymphocytes and crypt epithelial cell DR expression remained unaltered during the oat challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the absence of oat toxicity on the gluten sensitive small bowel mucosa and suggest that the rash in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis is not activated by eating oats.',\n",
              "  'Acquired EGFR C797S mutation mediates resistance to AZD9291 in non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR T790M. Here we studied cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) collected from subjects with advanced lung cancer whose tumors had developed resistance to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AZD9291. We first performed next-generation sequencing of cfDNA from seven subjects and detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one; expression of this mutant EGFR construct in a cell line rendered it resistant to AZD9291. We then performed droplet digital PCR on serial cfDNA specimens collected from 15 AZD9291-treated subjects. All were positive for the T790M mutation before treatment, but upon developing AZD9291 resistance three molecular subtypes emerged: six cases acquired the C797S mutation, five cases maintained the T790M mutation but did not acquire the C797S mutation and four cases lost the T790M mutation despite the presence of the underlying EGFR activating mutation. Our findings provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to AZD9291 and highlight the need for therapies that are able to overcome resistance mediated by the EGFR C797S mutation.',\n",
              "  'A novel Abeta isoform pattern in CSF reflects gamma-secretase inhibition in Alzheimer disease. INTRODUCTION: LY450139 (semagacestat) inhibits gamma-secretase, a key enzyme for generation of amyloid beta (Abeta), the peptide deposited in plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous data have shown that LY450139 lowers plasma Abeta, but has no clear effect on Abeta1-40 or Abeta1-42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By using targeted proteomics techniques, we recently identified several shorter Abeta isoforms, such as Abeta1-16, that in experimental settings increase during gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment, and thus may serve as sensitive biochemical indices of the treatment effect. Here, we test the hypothesis that these shorter Abeta isoforms may be biomarkers of gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment in clinical trials. METHODS: In a phase II clinical trial, 35 individuals with mild to moderate AD were randomized to placebo (n = 10) or LY450139 (100 mg (n = 15) or 140 mg (n = 10)) and underwent lumbar puncture at baseline and after 14 weeks of treatment. The CSF Abeta isoform pattern was analyzed with immunoprecipitation combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The CSF levels of Abeta1-14, Abeta1-15, and Abeta1-16 showed a dose-dependent increase by 57% and 74%, 21% and 35%, and 30% and 67%, respectively in the 100-mg and 140-mg treatment groups. Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were unaffected by treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CSF Abeta1-14, Abeta1-15, and Abeta1-16 increase during gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment in AD, even at doses that do not affect Abeta1-42 or Abeta1-40, probably because of increased substrate availability of the C99 APP stub (APP beta-CTF) induced by gamma-secretase inhibition. These Abeta isoforms may be novel sensitive biomarkers to monitor the biochemical effect in clinical trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov NCT00244322.',\n",
              "  'Clinical assessment of bortezomib for multiple myeloma in comparison with thalidomide. PURPOSE: We studied the efficacy and safety of bortezomib (BOR) for treatment of multiple myeloma in comparison with thalidomide (THAL) by reference to adverse events, and searched for laboratory markers that could be used for prognostication of patients. METHODS: Biochemical data of patients receiving BOR and THAL for treatment of multiple myeloma at the Japanese Red Cross Narita Hospital were investigated retrospectively, after obtaining Institutional Review Board approval. Judgment of curative effects complied with the effects criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG). RESULTS: BOR showed a higher rate of effectiveness than THAL for refractory multiple myeloma, and its effects were rapid. BOR treatment prolonged the survival time of THAL-resistant patients. The efficacy of BOR was unrelated to patient age, the number of previous therapeutic regimens, or the disease period. After medication with BOR, patients in whom it had been effective tended to show an increase of the serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level. Thrombocytopenia (86.2%) and leucopenia (69.0%) were observed at high frequencies, but no previously unreported adverse events or fatalities were associated with BOR therapy. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that BOR has therapeutic efficacy for multiple myeloma as a first-line medical treatment and/or for patients with THAL resistance, and can improve prognosis and survival. Since serum ALP elevation was observed in many patients for whom BOR was effective, this may be a predictor of BOR efficacy.',\n",
              "  'Protection from cardiac arrhythmia through ryanodine receptor-stabilizing protein calstabin2. Ventricular arrhythmias can cause sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with normal hearts and in those with underlying disease such as heart failure. In animals with heart failure and in patients with inherited forms of exercise-induced SCD, depletion of the channel-stabilizing protein calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the ryanodine receptor-calcium release channel (RyR2) complex causes an intracellular Ca2+ leak that can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias. A derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine (JTV519) increased the affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2, which stabilized the closed state of RyR2 and prevented the Ca2+ leak that triggers arrhythmias. Thus, enhancing the binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 may be a therapeutic strategy for common ventricular arrhythmias.',\n",
              "  'Dominant alleles identify SET domain residues required for histone methyltransferase of Polycomb repressive complex 2. Polycomb gene silencing requires histone methyltransferase activity of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which methylates lysine 27 of histone H3. Information on how PRC2 works is limited by lack of structural data on the catalytic subunit, Enhancer of zeste (E(Z)), and the paucity of E(z) mutant alleles that alter its SET domain. Here we analyze missense alleles of Drosophila E(z), selected for molecular study because of their dominant genetic effects. Four missense alleles identify key E(Z) SET domain residues, and a fifth is located in the adjacent CXC domain. Analysis of mutant PRC2 complexes in vitro, and H3-K27 methylation in vivo, shows that each SET domain mutation disrupts PRC2 histone methyltransferase. Based on known SET domain structures, the mutations likely affect either the lysine-substrate binding pocket, the binding site for the adenosylmethionine methyl donor, or a critical tyrosine predicted to interact with the substrate lysine epsilon-amino group. In contrast, the CXC mutant retains catalytic activity, Lys-27 specificity, and trimethylation capacity. Deletion analysis also reveals a functional requirement for a conserved E(Z) domain N-terminal to CXC and SET. These results identify critical SET domain residues needed for PRC2 enzyme function, and they also emphasize functional inputs from outside the SET domain.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a small vessel disease of the brain caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. CADASIL progresses, in some cases, to subcortical dementia with a particular cognitive impairment. Different diseases in the dementia spectrum share a central cholinergic and sensorimotor plasticity alteration. We aimed to study different intracortical circuits and sensorimotor plasticity in CADASIL patients using transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols, and to determine whether these characteristics correlated with the results of clinical neuropsychological evaluation. METHODS: Ten CADASIL patients and 10 healthy subjects were included in the study. All subjects underwent a transcranial magnetic stimulation study examining different intracortical circuits. Sensorimotor plasticity was also assessed using a paired associative stimulation and extensive neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: CADASIL patients showed a lack of intracortical facilitation, short latency afferent inhibition and sensorimotor plasticity when compared with control subjects. CADASIL patients also showed an altered neuropsychological profile. Correlation between sensorimotor plasticity and neuropsychological alterations was observed in CADASIL patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that acetylcholine and glutamate could be involved in the dementia process in CADASIL and that abnormal sensorimotor plasticity correlates with the neuropsychological profile in CADASIL patients.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether transvaginal ultrasound measurement of bladder wall thickness can be used as a screening test for detrusor instability in women with urinary symptoms. DESIGN: A blinded prospective study. SETTING: A London teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and eight-four symptomatic women presenting to a urodynamic clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The detection of detrusor instability by means of videocystourethrography (VCU) and ambulatory urodynamics in women with a mean bladder wall thickness of greater than 5 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound. RESULTS: One hundred and eight women had a mean bladder wall thickness of greater than 5 mm. Ninety-four percent (102) of these women had detrusor instability either when undergoing VCU or ambulatory urodynamics. Seventeen women had a bladder wall thickness of less than 3.5 mm of whom three were found to have detrusor instability on VCU. CONCLUSION: The measurement of a mean bladder wall thickness greater than 5 mm with transvaginal ultrasound is a sensitive screening method for diagnosing detrusor instability in symptomatic women without outflow obstruction.',\n",
              "  'Stable carbon isotopes and the study of prehistoric human diet. Mass spectrometric analysis of the stable carbon isotope composition (13C/12C or delta 13C) of bone collagen from human remains recovered at archaeological sites provides a direct chemical method for investigating dietary patterns of prehistoric human populations. This methodology is based on the facts that (1) different food items within the human diet have distinct delta 13C values, and (2) the delta 13C value of human bone collagen is determined by the delta 13C value of the diet. Studies of the development of subsistence patterns based on corn agriculture, one of the most significant developments in North American prehistory, can benefit from the use of stable carbon isotope techniques because corn has a high delta 13C value relative to other components of the human diet. Measurements of delta 13C of bone collagen from prehistoric human skeletal remains from southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas indicate that intensive corn agriculture began in this region around A.D. 1000, that the incorporation of corn into the human diet was a rapid phenomenon, and that 35 to 77% of the human diet from A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1600 consisted of corn. Results from an isochronous population in southeastern South Dakota (A.D. 1400) suggest that 78 to 90% of the diet of this group consisted of corn, with no difference between males and females. Coupled with more traditional archaeological methods, stable carbon isotope analysis of bone collagen can significantly enhance reconstruction of dietary patterns of prehistoric humans.',\n",

The effects of SEA0400, a selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), on Na(+)-dependent Ca(2+) uptake and catecholamine (CA) release were examined in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells that were loaded with Na(+) by treatment with ouabain and veratridine. SEA0400 inhibited Na(+)-dependent (45)Ca(2+) uptake and CA release, with the IC(50) values of 40 and 100 nM, respectively. The IC(50) values of another NCX inhibitor KB-R7943 were 1.8 and 3.7 microM, respectively. These results indicate that SEA0400 is about 40 times more potent than KB-R7943 in inhibiting NCX working in the reverse mode. In intact cells, SEA0400 and KB-R7943 inhibited CA release induced by acetylcholine and DMPP. The IC(50) values of SEA0400 were 5.1 and 4.5 microM and the values of KB-R7943 were 2.6 and 2.1 microM against the release induced by acetylcholine and DMPP, respectively, indicating that the potency of SEA0400 is about a half of that of KB-R7943 in inhibiting the nicotinic receptor-mediated CA release. The binding of [(3)H]nicotine with nicotinic receptors was inhibited by SEA0400 (IC(50) = 90 microM) and KB-R7943 (IC(50) = 12 microM). From these results, it is concluded that unlike KB-R7943, SEA0400 has a potent and selective action on NCX in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.',\n",

              "  'Inactivation of the Cullin (CUL)-RING E3 ligase by the NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 triggers protective autophagy in cancer cells. The multiunit Cullin (CUL)-RING E3 ligase (CRL) controls diverse biological processes by targeting a mass of substrates for ubiquitination and degradation, whereas its dysfunction causes carcinogenesis. Post-translational neddylation of CUL, a process triggered by the NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 subunit 1 (NAE1), is required for CRL activation. Recently, MLN4924 was discovered via a high-throughput screen as a specific NAE1 inhibitor and first-in-class anticancer drug. By blocking CUL neddylation, MLN4924 inactivates CRL and causes the accumulation of CRL substrates that trigger cell cycle arrest, senescence and/or apoptosis to suppress the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we found that MLN4924 also triggers protective autophagy in response to CRL inactivation. MLN4924-induced autophagy is attributed partially to the inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin (also known as mammalian target of rapamycin, MTOR) activity by the accumulation of the MTOR inhibitory protein DEPTOR, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress. Moreover, the blockage of autophagy response enhances apoptosis in MLN4924-treated cells. Together, our findings not only reveal autophagy as a novel cellular response to CRL inactivation by MLN4924, but also provide a piece of proof-of-concept evidence for the combination of MLN4924 with autophagy inhibitors to enhance therapeutic efficacy.',\n",

Detecting mutation in NF1 is hindered by the gene's large size, the lack of mutation hotspots, the presence of pseudogenes, and the wide variety of possible lesions. We developed a method for detecting germline mutations by combining an original RNA-based cDNA-PCR mutation detection method and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The protocol was validated in a cohort of 56 blood samples from NF1 patients who fulfilled NIH diagnostic criteria, identifying the germline mutation in 53 cases (95% sensitivity). The efficiency and reliability of this approach facilitated detection of different types of mutations, including single-base substitutions, deletions or insertions of one to several nucleotides, microdeletions, and changes in intragenic copy number. Because mutational screening for minor lesions was performed using cDNA and the characterization of mutated alleles was performed at both the RNA and genomic DNA level, the analysis provided insight into the nature of the different mutations and their effect on NF1 mRNA splicing. After validation, we implemented the protocol as a routine test. Here we present the overall unbiased spectrum of NF1 mutations identified in 93 patients in a cohort of 105. The results indicate that this protocol is a powerful new tool for the molecular diagnosis of NF1.\",\n",
              "  \"mpMoRFsDB: a database of molecular recognition features in membrane proteins. SUMMARY: Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are small, intrinsically disordered regions in proteins that undergo a disorder-to-order transition on binding to their partners. MoRFs are involved in protein-protein interactions and may function as the initial step in molecular recognition. The aim of this work was to collect, organize and store all membrane proteins that contain MoRFs. Membrane proteins constitute ∼30% of fully sequenced proteomes and are responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions. MoRFs were classified according to their secondary structure, after interacting with their partners. We identified MoRFs in transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins. The position of transmembrane protein MoRFs was determined in relation to a protein's topology. All information was stored in a publicly available mySQL database with a user-friendly web interface. A Jmol applet is integrated for visualization of the structures. mpMoRFsDB provides valuable information related to disorder-based protein-protein interactions in membrane proteins.

              "  'Genetically determined neuromuscular disorders of some Roma families living in Hungary. The authors discuss the clinical and molecular genetic aspects of genetically determined neuromuscular disorders of some Roma families living in Hungary. Among the autosomal recessively inherited spinal muscular atrophic (SMA) group, 8 Caucasian children had the typical 7-8 exonal deletions of the SMA gene, but only 2 patients belonged to the Roma population. There was no difference in the molecular genetic findings among the Caucasian and the Roma SMA patients. All of them had 7-8 exonal deletions of the SMA gene. We wanted to call attention to the founder mutation of the Roma population in 7 patients suffering from congenital myasthenia (CMS) from 3 Roma families. The 1267G deletion for CMS was detected by molecular genetic method. Clinical onset was pubertal and relatively slow progression of specific and phenotypic features for this founder mutation of acetyl-cholin receptor epsylon gene. In 2 patients (sister and brother) the sarcoglycanopathy 2C type C283Q mutation was proven in one Roma family suffering from limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD). Two out of the three facioscapular-humeral dystrophy (FSHD) Roma families carried 21.8 kb and 18.5 kb alleles in FSHD A1 gene (D4S139). In one family together with prenatal diagnosis founder mutation in FSHD A1 gene was detected, according to the autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance. In (F2) prenatal diagnosis was carried out, 18.5 kb/18.5 kb homozygosity was proven in the fetus, so the pregnancy was interrupted. In the CMS, LGMD and FSHD Roma patients ancient typical Roma founder mutations were found.',\n",
              "  'Monitoring twenty-six chronic myeloid leukemia patients by BCR-ABL mRNA level in bone marrow:a single hospital experience. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL oncogene. The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) from a reciprocal translocation, t(9;22) (q34;q11) causes a fusion gene, BCR-ABL, that encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. Treatment of CML by imatinib is effective to control the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the protein related to the cell signaling. BCR-ABL mRNA is overexpressed in the minimal residual disease (MRD), known as an early sign of relapse. Between December 2005 and June 2008, we measured BCR-ABL mRNA levels in the bone marrow (BM) from patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital. Eighty-six samples from 26 patients were collected. Among the 26 CML patients, 11 patients (42%) were in the pretreatment group. Seven (64%) of the 11 patients achieved complete molecular response (CMR). In the post-treatment group consisting of the remaining 15 patients, 9 (60%) patients achieved CMR. The patients receiving imatinib at a dose over 300 mg per day required 13 (6-77) months [median (range)] to achieve CMR. On the other hand, the patients receiving a dose below 300 mg per day required 29.5 (11-84) months [median (range)]. When BCR-ABL mRNA was detected during the treatment course of patients with CMR, careful observation of BCR-ABL mRNA was useful for tracking the clinical course of patients. In conclusion, the BCR-ABL mRNA level was useful for monitoring the clinical course in 26 patients with CML.',\n",

Delamanid (Deltyba(®)), a nitroimidazo-oxazole derivative, is a new anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug which exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antitubercular activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is approved in several countries, including Japan and those of the EU, for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen in adults with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed due to resistance or tolerability. In a robust phase\\xa0II trial in adult patients with MDR-TB, oral delamanid 100\\xa0mg twice daily for 2\\xa0months plus an optimized background regimen improved sputum culture conversion rates to a significantly greater extent than placebo. In a 6-month extension study, long-term ( < 8\\xa0months) treatment with delamanid was associated with a higher incidence of favourable outcomes (i.e. cured or completed all treatment) than short-term ( < 2\\xa0months) treatment, with an accompanying reduction inunfavourable outcomes as defined by the WHO (i.e. pre-specified proportion of TB-positive sputum cultures, death or treatment discontinuation for > 2\\xa0months without medical approval). Delamanid was not associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions, including with antiretroviral drugs and those commonly used in treating TB. Delamanid was generally well tolerated in patients with MDR-TB, with gastrointestinal adverse events and insomnia reported most commonly. Although the incidence of QT interval prolongation was higher with delamanid-based therapy, it was not associated with clinical symptoms such as syncope and arrhythmia. In conclusion, delamanid is a useful addition to the treatment options currently available for patients with MDR-TB.',\n",
              "  'Resolving the daratumumab interference with blood compatibility testing. BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myeloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells. During routine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a positive antibody screen and panreactivity on red blood cell (RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized that the observed panreactivity reflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs, and we investigated methods to prevent this binding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. To remove cell surface CD38, cells were incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) or trypsin. Soluble CD38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA in solution. Routine blood bank serologic methods were used to test samples from DARA-treated patients and normal plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HL60 cells, but not to CD38- controls. DTT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA binding by 92% by denaturing cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DTT is a robust method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patients. Because DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are provided to these patients.',\n",
              "  'Intrahepatic biliary anomalies in a patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome uncover a role for the zinc finger homeobox gene zfhx1b in vertebrate biliary development. BACKGROUND: zfhz1b is the causative gene for Mowat-Wilson syndrome, in which patients demonstrate developmental delay and Hirschsprung disease, as well as other anomalies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome who also developed cholestasis and histopathologic features consistent with biliary atresia, suggesting that mutations involving zfhz1b may lead to biliary developmental anomalies or injury to the biliary tract. We used the zebrafish model system to determine whether zfhx1b has a role in vertebrate biliary development. RESULTS: Using zebrafish we determined that zfhx1b was expressed in the developing liver during biliary growth and remodeling, and that morpholino antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of zfhx1b led to defects in biliary development. These findings were associated with decreased expression of vhnf1, a transcription factor known to be important in biliary development in zebrafish and in mammals. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies underscore the importance of genetic contributions in the etiology of infantile hepatobiliary disorders, including biliary atresia.',\n",
              "  'Assessment of severe malaria in a multicenter, phase III, RTS, S/AS01 malaria candidate vaccine trial: case definition, standardization of data collection and patient care. BACKGROUND: An effective malaria vaccine, deployed in conjunction with other malaria interventions, is likely to substantially reduce the malaria burden. Efficacy against severe malaria will be a key driver for decisions on implementation. An initial study of an RTS, S vaccine candidate showed promising efficacy against severe malaria in children in Mozambique. Further evidence of its protective efficacy will be gained in a pivotal, multi-centre, phase III study. This paper describes the case definitions of severe malaria used in this study and the programme for standardized assessment of severe malaria according to the case definition. METHODS: Case definitions of severe malaria were developed from a literature review and a consensus meeting of expert consultants and the RTS, S Clinical Trial Partnership Committee, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance. The same groups, with input from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, developed and implemented a programme for standardized data collection.The case definitions developed reflect the typical presentations of severe malaria in African hospitals. Markers of disease severity were chosen on the basis of their association with poor outcome, occurrence in a significant proportion of cases and on an ability to standardize their measurement across research centres. For the primary case definition, one or more clinical and/or laboratory markers of disease severity have to be present, four major co-morbidities (pneumonia, meningitis, bacteraemia or gastroenteritis with severe dehydration) are excluded, and a Plasmodium falciparum parasite density threshold is introduced, in order to maximize the specificity of the case definition. Secondary case definitions allow inclusion of co-morbidities and/or allow for the presence of parasitaemia at any density. The programmatic implementation of standardized case assessment included a clinical algorithm for evaluating seriously sick children, improvements to care delivery and a robust training and evaluation programme for clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: The case definition developed for the pivotal phase III RTS, S vaccine study is consistent with WHO recommendations, is locally applicable and appropriately balances sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of severe malaria. Processes set up to standardize severe malaria data collection will allow robust assessment of the efficacy of the RTS, S vaccine against severe malaria, strengthen local capacity and benefit patient care for subjects in the trial.

              "  'Use of flumazenil in the treatment of drug overdose: a double-blind and open clinical study in 110 patients. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, usefulness, safety, and dosages of flumazenil required when flumazenil is used in the diagnosis of benzodiazepine-induced coma (vs. other drug-induced coma), and to reverse or prevent the recurrence of unconsciousness. DESIGN: A two-phase study: a controlled, randomized, double-blind study followed by a prospective, open study. SETTING: An 800-bed, teaching, university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Unconscious patients (n = 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The first 31 patients were studied in a double-blind fashion, while the rest of the patients were given flumazenil according to an open protocol. INTERVENTIONS; All patients received supplemental oxygen; endotracheal intubation was performed, and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation was initiated whenever it was deemed necessary. A peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted, as were indwelling arterial and urinary bladder catheters. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, and core temperature were continuously monitored. The first 31 double-blind patients received either intravenous flumazenil (to a maximum of 1 mg) or saline, while the rest of the patients were given flumazenil until either regaining consciousness or a maximum of 2.5 mg was injected. Patients remaining unconscious among double-blind patients or those patients relapsing into coma after the first dose were later treated in the open phase of the study. Treatment continued by boluses or infusion as long as efficacious. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Twenty-five percent of the patients did not regain consciousness. These patients had very high serum concentrations of nonbenzodiazepine drugs. Sixty percent of the responders who had primarily ingested benzodiazepines remained awake for 72 +/- 37 mins after flumazenil administration; 40% relapsed into coma after 18 +/- 7 mins and various central nervous system depressant drugs were detected in their blood in addition to benzodiazepines. Seventy-one percent of the patients had ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Seventy-eight percent of the responders were continually and efficaciously treated for < or = 8 days. Fourteen (25%) of the intubated patients were extubated safely while 12 patients, who had shown increased respiratory insufficiency, resumed satisfactory respiration after flumazenil injection. Five cases of transient increase in blood pressure and heart rate were encountered. There were 27 mildly unpleasant \"waking\" episodes, such as anxiety, restlessness, and aggression, but no patient had benzodiazepine withdrawal signs, convulsions, or dysrhythmia, most noticeably absent in tricyclic antidepressant-intoxicated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil is a valid diagnostic tool for distinguishing pure benzodiazepine from mixed-drug intoxication or nondrug-induced coma. Flumazenil is effective in preventing recurrence of benzodiazepine-induced coma. Respiratory insufficiency is reversed after its administration. Flumazenil is safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed overdose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants.',\n",
              "  'Insights into extensive deletions around the XK locus associated with McLeod phenotype and characterization of two novel cases. The McLeod phenotype is derived from various forms of XK gene defects that result in the absence of XK protein, and is defined hematologically by the absence of Kx antigen, weakening of Kell system antigens, and red cell acanthocytosis. Individuals with the McLeod phenotype usually develop late-onset neuromuscular abnormalities known as the McLeod syndrome (MLS). MLS is an X-linked multi-system disorder caused by absence of XK alone, or when the disorder is caused by large deletions, it may be accompanied with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), chronic granulomatous disease (CYBB), retinitis pigmentosa (RPGR), and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC). XK defects derived from a large deletion at the XK locus (Xp21.1) have not been characterized at the molecular level. In this study, the deletion breakpoints of two novel cases of McLeod phenotype with extensive deletions are reported. Case 1 has greater than 1.12 million base-pairs (mb) deletion around the XK locus with 7 genes affected. Case 2 has greater than 5.65 mb deletion from TCTE1L to DMD encompassing 20 genes. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that DMD, XK and CYBB have close paralogs, some of which may partially substitute for the functions of their counterparts. The loci around XK are highly conserved from fish to human; however, the disorders are probably specific to mammals, and may coincide with the translocation of the loci to the X chromosome after the speciation in birds. The non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratio (omega=dN/dS) in these genes was examined. CYBB and RPGR show evidence of positive selection, whereas DMD, XK and OTC are subject to selective constraint.',\n",

Heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) used commonly are the standard treatment of venous and arterial thromboses. They are very efficient and safe, but have some limitations: iatrogenicity, laboratory monitoring, parenteral use for heparins and fondaparinux. Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The objective is to substitute these indirect inhibitors of factor Xa (heparins, low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux) in the prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic episodes. The new direct inhibitors do not require routine laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation. They inhibit the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are efficacious and safe in the prevention of cerebral infarcts in patients with non-valvular fibrillation. Apixaban is another direct inhibitor of factor Xa used orally which is developed in the same indications as rivaroxaban. Edoxaban and betrixaban are also in development. The objective of this work is to study the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, the efficacy and safety of these four oral direct factor Xa inhibitors.',\n",

              "  'Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat in Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia. BACKGROUND: Imetelstat, a 13-mer oligonucleotide that is covalently modified with lipid extensions, competitively inhibits telomerase enzymatic activity. It has been shown to inhibit megakaryocytic proliferation in vitro in cells obtained from patients with essential thrombocythemia. In this phase 2 study, we investigated whether imetelstat could elicit hematologic and molecular responses in patients with essential thrombocythemia who had not had a response to or who had had unacceptable side effects from prior therapies. METHODS: A total of 18 patients in two sequential cohorts received an initial dose of 7.5 or 9.4 mg of imetelstat per kilogram of body weight intravenously once a week until attainment of a platelet count of approximately 250,000 to 300,000 per cubic millimeter. The primary end point was the best hematologic response. RESULTS: Imetelstat induced hematologic responses in all 18 patients, and 16 patients (89%) had a complete hematologic response. At the time of the primary analysis, 10 patients were still receiving treatment, with a median follow-up of 17 months (range, 7 to 32 [ongoing]). Molecular responses were seen in 7 of 8 patients who were positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation (88%; 95% confidence interval, 47 to 100). CALR and MPL mutant allele burdens were also reduced by 15 to 66%. The most common adverse events during treatment were mild to moderate in severity; neutropenia of grade 3 or higher occurred in 4 of the 18 patients (22%) and anemia, headache, and syncope of grade 3 or higher each occurred in 2 patients (11%). All the patients had at least one abnormal liver-function value; all persistent elevations were grade 1 or 2 in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and durable hematologic and molecular responses were observed in patients with essential thrombocythemia who received imetelstat.

              "  'Heme mediates derepression of Maf recognition element through direct binding to transcription repressor Bach1. Heme controls expression of genes involved in the synthesis of globins and heme. The mammalian transcription factor Bach1 functions as a repressor of the Maf recognition element (MARE) by forming antagonizing hetero-oligomers with the small Maf family proteins. We show here that heme binds specifically to Bach1 and regulates its DNA-binding activity. Deletion studies demonstrated that a heme-binding region of Bach1 is confined within its C-terminal region that possesses four dipeptide cysteine-proline (CP) motifs. Mutations in all of the CP motifs of Bach1 abolished its interaction with heme. The DNA-binding activity of Bach1 as a MafK hetero-oligomer was markedly inhibited by heme in gel mobility shift assays. The repressor activity of Bach1 was lost upon addition of hemin in transfected cells. These results suggest that increased levels of heme inactivate the repressor Bach1, resulting in induction of a host of genes with MARES:',\n",

              "  'JTV519 (K201) reduces sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ leak and improves diastolic function in vitro in murine and human non-failing myocardium. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ca²⁺ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction. RyR2 Ca²⁺ leak has been related to RyR2 phosphorylation. In these conditions, JTV519 (K201), a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative and multi-channel blocker, stabilizes RyR2s and decrease SR Ca²⁺ leak. We investigated whether JTV519 stabilizes RyR2s without increasing RyR2 phosphorylation in mice and in non-failing human myocardium and explored underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: SR Ca²⁺ leak was induced by ouabain in murine cardiomyocytes. [Ca²⁺]-transients, SR Ca²⁺ load and RyR2-mediated Ca²⁺ leak (sparks/waves) were quantified, with or without JTV519 (1 µmol·L⁻¹). Contribution of Ca²⁺ -/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was assessed by KN-93 and Western blot (RyR2-Ser(2814) phosphorylation). Effects of JTV519 on contractile force were investigated in non-failing human ventricular trabeculae. KEY RESULTS: Ouabain increased systolic and diastolic cytosolic [Ca²⁺](i) , SR [Ca²⁺], and SR Ca²⁺ leak (Ca²⁺ spark (SparkF) and Ca²⁺ wave frequency), independently of CaMKII and RyR-Ser(2814) phosphorylation. JTV519 decreased SparkF but also SR Ca²⁺ load. At matched SR [Ca²⁺], Ca²⁺ leak was significantly reduced by JTV519, but it had no effect on fractional Ca²⁺ release or Ca²⁺ wave propagation velocity. In human muscle, JTV519 was negatively inotropic at baseline but significantly enhanced ouabain-induced force and reduced its deleterious effects on diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: JTV519 was effective in reducing SR Ca²⁺ leak by specifically regulating RyR2 opening at diastolic [Ca²⁺](i) in the absence of increased RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser(2814) , extending the potential use of JTV519 to conditions of acute cellular Ca²⁺ overload.',\n",
              "  'High incidence of iron depletion and restless leg syndrome (RLS) in regular blood donors: intravenous iron sucrose substitution more effective than oral iron. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Iron depletion is common in regular blood donors. The objective of the study was to investigate the frequency and severity of iron depletion in regular blood donors and whether IV iron is more effective than oral to avoid iron depletion and symptoms thereof, especially restless legs syndrome (RLS). METHOD: One hundred and twenty blood donors with at least five previous whole blood donations were randomized to receive either IV iron sucrose (Venofer(®), RenaPharma/Vifor, Uppsala, Sweden), 200 mg, or to 20×100 mg of oral iron sulphate (Duroferon(®), GlaxoSmithKline, Stockholm, Sweden), after each blood donation during 1 year. Iron status and RLS incidence and severity were investigated. RESULTS: Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%). The IV iron group increased storage iron to a greater extent than the oral iron group after 12 months (P=0·0043). Female donors were more responsive to IV iron sucrose compared to oral iron sulphate, particularly female donors below 50 years of age. RLS severity scores were significantly lower in the IV iron group. The two treatments were safe. CONCLUSION: Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient. IV iron sucrose substitutes iron loss in blood donors more efficiently compared with oral iron sulphate, especially in women. Iron substitution to blood donors should be individualized and based on P-ferritin monitoring.',\n",

Imatinib mesylate (IM) binds to the BCR-ABL protein, inhibiting its kinase activity and effectively controlling diseases driven by this kinase. IM resistance has been associated with kinase mutations or increased BCR-ABL expression. However, disease progression may be mediated by other mechanisms that render tumor cells independent of BCR-ABL. To demonstrate this potential, IM-resistant cells were found in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients with continuous BCR-ABL gene expression but undetectable BCR-ABL protein expression. These cells were unresponsive to IM and acquired BCR-ABL-independent signaling characteristics. IM resistance in some patients may be mediated through loss of kinase target dependence.',\n",

This randomized, double-blind study (NCT01323972) assessed consistency of three RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine batches formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots in terms of anti-CS-responses induced. METHODS: Healthy children aged 5-17 months were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive RTS,S/AS01 at 0-1-2 months from one of three commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots (1600 litres-fermentation scale; commercial-scale lots), or a comparator vaccine batch made from pilot-scale purified antigen bulk lot (20 litres-fermentation scale; pilot-scale lot). The co-primary objectives were to first demonstrate consistency of antibody responses against circumsporozoite (CS) protein at one month post-dose 3 for the three commercial-scale lots and second demonstrate non-inferiority of anti-CS antibody responses at one month post-dose 3 for the commercial-scale lots compared to the pilot-scale lot. Safety and reactogenicity were evaluated as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: One month post-dose-3, anti-CS antibody geometric mean titres (GMT) for the 3 commercial scale lots were 319.6 EU/ml (95% confidence interval (CI): 268.9-379.8), 241.4 EU/ml (207.6-280.7), and 302.3 EU/ml (259.4-352.3). Consistency for the RTS,S/AS01 commercial-scale lots was demonstrated as the two-sided 95% CI of the anti-CS antibody GMT ratio between each pair of lots was within the range of 0.5-2.0. GMT of the pooled commercial-scale lots (285.8 EU/ml (260.7-313.3)) was non-inferior to the pilot-scale lot (271.7 EU/ml (228.5-323.1)). Each RTS,S/AS01 lot had an acceptable tolerability profile, with infrequent reports of grade 3 solicited symptoms. No safety signals were identified and no serious adverse events were considered related to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: RTS,S/AS01 lots formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk batches induced a consistent anti-CS antibody response, and the anti-CS GMT of pooled commercial-scale lots was non-inferior to that of a lot formulated from a pilot-scale antigen bulk batch.',\n",
              "  'Genetic causes of goiter and deafness: Pendred syndrome in a girl and cooccurrence of Pendred syndrome and resistance to thyroid hormone in her sister. CONTEXT: Goiter and deafness can be associated in some genetic syndromes, e.g. Pendred syndrome (PS) and resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). PS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by goiter and sensorineural hearing impairment with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct bilaterally. RTH is an autosomal dominant condition of reduced tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormone in which goiter is very frequent and hearing loss occurs in about 20% of patients. OBJECTIVE, PATIENTS, AND DESIGN: The objective of this study was to identify the cause of goiter and deafness in two sisters born to healthy unrelated parents. We present their history, clinical presentation, and follow-up and report the results of molecular genetic investigations. RESULTS: The elder sister had an elevated TSH level at newborn screening followed by subclinical hypothyroidism, childhood-onset goiter, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts, consistent with a diagnosis of PS. Her younger sister had congenital goiter, elevated free T3 and free T4 concentrations with unsuppressed TSH, sinus tachycardia, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts. This clinical presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of RTH, in which, however, inner ear malformations are uncommon. Interestingly, molecular genetic testing showed that, whereas the elder sister is affected by PS, the younger sister has both PS (due to compound heterozygous SLC26A4 mutations) and RTH (due to a novel de novo heterozygous THRB mutation). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the cooccurrence, in the same individual, of PS and RTH, two genetic syndromes both associated with goiter and hearing impairment.',\n",
              "  'Parallel expression of macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) in duodenal and skin lesions of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a specific dermatological manifestation of coeliac disease and 80% of DH patients have gluten sensitive enteropathy manifested by crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy. Matrix degradation mediated by collagenase 1 (MMP-1) and stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) has previously been implicated in the pathobiology of coeliac intestine and cutaneous DH blisters. AIMS: To study expression of stromelysin 2, metalloelastase, collagenase 3, and matrilysin in the intestine and skin of DH patients. METHODS: In situ hybridisation using 35S labelled cRNA probes was performed on duodenal biopsies of 15 DH patients, three samples each of control duodenal or jejunal mucosa, fetal ileal explants, lesional DH skin, and 19 serial biopsies of experimental DH blisters. Immunostaining was used to examine type IV collagen, macrophages (CD68), and 92 kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) in the specimens. RESULTS: Metalloelastase (MMP-12) was abundantly expressed by subepithelial macrophages in both coeliac intestine and spontaneous and induced DH rash. It was also upregulated in the experimental model of coeliac disease (staphylococcal endotoxin B stimulated fetal explants). The only other MMP detected was MMP-9 which did not colocalise with MMP-12. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of metalloelastase is associated with T cell mediated immune responses both in the intestine and skin. In addition to modulating macrophage migration, it may contribute to degradation of proteoglycans or basement membrane components in the subepithelial mucosa.',\n",

              "  \"The relevance of Simpson Grade I and II resection in modern neurosurgical treatment of World Health Organization Grade I meningiomas. OBJECT: In 1957, Simpson published a seminal paper defining the risk factors for recurrence following surgical treatment of intracranial meningiomas. Given that Simpson's study was published more than 50 years ago, preceding image guidance technology and MR imaging, the authors reviewed their own experience with surgical treatment of Grade I meningiomas to determine if Simpson's grading scale is still relevant to modern neurosurgical practice. METHODS: From this cohort, the authors evaluated all patients undergoing craniotomy for resection of a histologically proven WHO Grade I meningioma as their initial therapy. Clinical information was retrospectively reconstructed using patient medical records and radiological data. Recurrence analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The 5-year recurrence/progression-free survival for all patients receiving a Simpson Grade I, II, III, or IV resection was 95, 85, 88, and 81%, respectively (p = not significant, log-rank test). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between patients receiving a Simpson Grade I, II, III, or IV resection. Analysis limited to meningiomas arising from the skull base (excluding the cavernous sinus) similarly found no significant benefit to Simpson Grade I or II resection, and the survival curves were nearly superimposed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of a cohort of patients undergoing surgery for WHO Grade I meningiomas, the authors demonstrate that the benefit of more aggressive attempts to resect the tumor with dura and underlying bone was negligible compared with simply removing the entire tumor, or even leaving small amounts of tumor attached to critical structures. The authors believe that these data reflect an evolution in the nature of meningioma surgery over the past 2 decades, and bring into question the relevance of using Simpson's grading system as the sole predictor of recurrence.\",\n",
              "  'Gender differences in Latin-American patients with rheumatoid arthritis. BACKGROUND: Data on the effect of gender in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in non-Caucasian populations is scarce. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is a large population with unique characteristics, including high admixture. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the effect of gender in patients with RA in LAC. METHODS: This was a 2-phase study. First we conducted a cross-sectional and analytical study in which 1128 consecutive Colombian patients with RA were assessed. Second, a systematic review of the literature was done to evaluate the effect of gender in LAC patients with RA. RESULTS: Our results show a high prevalence of RA in LAC women with a ratio of 5.2 women per man. Colombian women with RA are more at risk of having an early age at onset and developing polyautoimmunity and abdominal obesity, and they perform more household duties than their male counterparts. However, male gender was associated with the presence of extra-articular manifestations. Of a total of 641 potentially relevant articles, 38 were considered for final analysis, in which several factors and outcomes related to gender were identified. CONCLUSIONS: RA in LAC women is not only more common but presents with some clinical characteristics that differ from RA presentation in men. Some of those characteristics could explain the high rates of disability and worse prognosis observed in women with RA in LAC.',\n",
              "  'McLeod phenotype associated with a XK missense mutation without hematologic, neuromuscular, or cerebral involvement. BACKGROUND: The X-linked McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is a multisystem disorder with hematologic, neuromuscular, and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. All carriers of the McLeod blood group phenotype examined so far had at least subclinical signs of systemic involvement. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Evaluation of two brothers carrying the McLeod phenotype with neurologic examination, immunohematology, RBC membrane protein Western blotting, analysis of XK DNA sequence and RNA levels, muscle histology including XK/Kell immunohistochemistry, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and quantified positron emission tomography (PET). RESULTS: Immunohematology and Western blotting confirmed presence of the McLeod blood group phenotype. No acanthocytosis or other hematologic anomalies were found. XK gene sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in exon 3 (E327K). WBC XK RNA levels were not decreased. There were no neuromuscular and CNS signs or symptoms. In addition, no subclinical involvement was discovered on the basis of normal muscle histology with a physiologic pattern of XK and Kell immunohistochemistry, normal cerebral MRI, and quantified PET. CONCLUSION: Known disease-causing XK gene mutations comprised deletions, nonsense, or splice-site mutations predicting absent or truncated XK protein devoid of the Kell-protein binding site. Although the E327K missense mutation was associated with the immunohematologic characteristics of McLeod syndrome, the mutated XK protein seemed to be largely functional. These findings contribute to the understanding of the physiology of XK and Kell proteins, and the pathogenetic mechanisms of acanthocytosis, myopathy, and striatal neurodegeneration in McLeod syndrome.',\n",

Ixazomib is the first investigational oral proteasome inhibitor to be studied clinically. In this phase 1 trial, 60 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (median of 4 prior lines of therapy; bortezomib, lenalidomide, thalidomide, and carfilzomib/marizomib in 88%, 88%, 62%, and 5%, respectively) received single-agent ixazomib 0.24 to 2.23 mg/m(2) (days 1, 4, 8, 11; 21-day cycles). Two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 rash; grade 4 thrombocytopenia) occurred at 2.23 mg/m(2). The maximum tolerated dose was 2.0 mg/m(2), which 40 patients received in 4 expansion cohorts. Patients received a median of 4 cycles (range, 1-39); 18% received > 12 cycles. Eighty-eight percent had drug-related adverse events, including nausea (42%), thrombocytopenia (42%), fatigue (40%), and rash (40%); drug-related grade > 3 events included thrombocytopenia (37%) and neutropenia (17%). Grade 1/2 drug-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12% (no grade > 3). Two patients died on the study (both considered unrelated to treatment). The terminal half-life of ixazomib was 3.3 to 7.4 days; plasma exposure increased proportionally with dose (0.48-2.23 mg/m(2)). Among 55 response-evaluable patients, 15% achieved partial response or better (76% stable disease or better). These findings have informed the subsequent clinical development of ixazomib in multiple myeloma. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00932698.',\n",
              "  'Molecular and cellular bases of chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the overproduction of granulocytes, which leads to high white blood cell counts and splenomegaly in patients. Based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, CML is classified into three clinical phases, often starting with a chronic phase, progressing to an accelerated phase and ultimately ending in a terminal phase called blast crisis. Blast crisis phase of CML is clinically similar to an acute leukemia; in particular, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a severe form of acute leukemia in blast crisis, and there is no effective therapy for it yet. CML is induced by the BCR-ABL oncogene, whose gene product is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Currently, inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by its kinase inhibitor such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a major therapeutic strategy for CML. However, the inability of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors to completely kill leukemia stem cells (LSCs) indicates that these kinase inhibitors are unlikely to cure CML. In addition, drug resistance due to the development of BCRABL mutations occurs before and during treatment of CML with kinase inhibitors. A critical issue to resolve this problem is to fully understand the biology of LSCs, and to identify key genes that play significant roles in survival and self-renewal of LSCs. In this review, we will focus on LSCs in CML by summarizing and discussing available experimental results, including the original studies from our own laboratory.',\n",
              "  'High incidence of iron depletion and restless leg syndrome (RLS) in regular blood donors: intravenous iron sucrose substitution more effective than oral iron. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Iron depletion is common in regular blood donors. The objective of the study was to investigate the frequency and severity of iron depletion in regular blood donors and whether IV iron is more effective than oral to avoid iron depletion and symptoms thereof, especially restless legs syndrome (RLS). METHOD: One hundred and twenty blood donors with at least five previous whole blood donations were randomized to receive either IV iron sucrose (Venofer(®), RenaPharma/Vifor, Uppsala, Sweden), 200 mg, or to 20×100 mg of oral iron sulphate (Duroferon(®), GlaxoSmithKline, Stockholm, Sweden), after each blood donation during 1 year. Iron status and RLS incidence and severity were investigated. RESULTS: Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%). The IV iron group increased storage iron to a greater extent than the oral iron group after 12 months (P=0·0043). Female donors were more responsive to IV iron sucrose compared to oral iron sulphate, particularly female donors below 50 years of age. RLS severity scores were significantly lower in the IV iron group. The two treatments were safe. CONCLUSION: Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient. IV iron sucrose substitutes iron loss in blood donors more efficiently compared with oral iron sulphate, especially in women. Iron substitution to blood donors should be individualized and based on P-ferritin monitoring.',\n",
              "  'Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations. BACKGROUND: Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with TP53 mutations is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who underwent genetic testing for suspected germline TP53 mutations and who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011. The pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation (cases) were compared with those testing negative (controls). RESULTS: Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). Among patients with a mutation, 70% had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the control group (P = .87). After adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, having a HER2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a germline TP53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). For each yearly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a TP53 mutation of 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. If confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating HER2-targeted therapies, and elucidate some of the molecular pathways involved in breast cancer.',\n",
              "  'The new oral anticoagulants: a challenge for hospital formularies. Introduction Over the past 60 years, clinicians have used vitamin K antagonists, primarily warfarin, as the sole oral anticoagulants for managing a variety of thrombotic disorders. Warfarin, which requires frequent monitoring, has a variable dose response, a narrow therapeutic index, and numerous drug and dietary interactions. However, intravenous and subcutaneous agents, such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccharide, have been introduced over the past 30 years for managing thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced into clinical trials. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. These drugs have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring in order to adjust therapy, which is the mainstay of warfarin management. In addition, these new medications have not shown any major issues regarding food interactions; rather, they demonstrate the potential for limited drug-drug interactions due to their limited metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. This unique pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders. Two of these agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); in addition, rivaroxaban can be used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in total hip and knee arthroplasty during the acute and extended periods of risk. However, the challenge for hospital formularies will be the appropriate use and management of these new medications as they become integrated into outpatient care. In order to better understand the issues that pharmacy and therapeutics committees will encounter, a review of the 2 FDA-approved oral anticoagulants will be evaluated.',\n",
              "  'Effects of acute and repeated treatment with a novel dopamine D2 receptor ligand on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in MPTP monkeys. (S)-(-)-3-(3-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-1-propylpiperidine ((-)-OSU6162) is a phenylpiperidine derivative which exhibits low affinity to the dopamine D2 receptor in vitro. However, in vivo, positron emission tomography scanning studies show that the compound displaces the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride. We have evaluated, in this study, the effect of (-)-OSU6162, on L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias in a primate model of Parkinson\\'s disease. Five 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated cynomolgus monkeys with a stable parkinsonian syndrome and reproducible dyskinesias to L-DOPA were used in this study. The monkeys were housed in observation cages equipped with an electronic motility monitoring system. They were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with L-DOPA methyl ester (125 mg per animal) plus benserazide (50 mg per animal; L-DOPA/benserazide) alone or in combination with (-)-OSU6162 (1.0, 3.0, 6.0 or 10 mg/kg, s.c.). Subcutaneous injection of sterile saline was used as control. L-DOPA/benserazide increased locomotion and improved parkinsonism but also induced dyskinesias. Co-administration of (-)-OSU6162 with L-DOPA/benserazide produced a significant reduction in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. This improvement in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias occurred mainly at the onset of the L-DOPA/benserazide effect as reflected by an increase in the duration of the \"ON\" state without dyskinesias up to 3.4 fold after (-)-OSU6162 co-administration as compared to L-DOPA/benserazide alone. The anti-dyskinetic effect of (-)-OSU6162 was maintained during 14 days and no tolerance to this effect was observed. Our data suggests that (-)-OSU6162 could be of significant clinical value to reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in fluctuating advanced Parkinson\\'s disease patients.',\n",

              "  'Crystal structure of the human OX2 orexin receptor bound to the insomnia drug suvorexant. The orexin (also known as hypocretin) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) respond to orexin neuropeptides in the central nervous system to regulate sleep and other behavioural functions in humans. Defects in orexin signalling are responsible for the human diseases of narcolepsy and cataplexy; inhibition of orexin receptors is an effective therapy for insomnia. The human OX2 receptor (OX2R) belongs to the β branch of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, and can bind to diverse compounds including the native agonist peptides orexin-A and orexin-B and the potent therapeutic inhibitor suvorexant. Here, using lipid-mediated crystallization and protein engineering with a novel fusion chimaera, we solved the structure of the human OX2R bound to suvorexant at 2.5\\xa0Å resolution. The structure reveals how suvorexant adopts a π-stacked horseshoe-like conformation and binds to the receptor deep in the orthosteric pocket, stabilizing a network of extracellular salt bridges and blocking transmembrane helix motions necessary for activation. Computational docking suggests how other classes of synthetic antagonists may interact with the receptor at a similar position in an analogous π-stacked fashion. Elucidation of the molecular architecture of the human OX2R expands our understanding of peptidergic GPCR ligand recognition and will aid further efforts to modulate orexin signalling for therapeutic ends.',\n",
              "  'Phospholamban overexpression in rabbit ventricular myocytes does not alter sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca transport. Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. Our understanding of the function of phospholamban stems primarily from studies in genetically altered mouse models. To evaluate the significance of this protein in larger mammalian species, which exhibit Ca cycling properties similar to humans, we overexpressed phospholamban in adult rabbit cardiomyocytes. Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, at high multiplicities of infection, resulted in an insignificant 1.22-fold overexpression of phospholamban. There were no effects on twitch Ca-transient amplitude or decay under basal or isoproterenol-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, the SR Ca load and Na/Ca exchanger function were not altered. These apparent differences between phospholamban overexpression in rabbit compared with previous findings in the mouse may be due to a significantly higher (1.5-fold) endogenous phospholamban-to-sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 2a ratio and potential functional saturation of SERCA2a by phospholamban in rabbit cardiomyocytes. The findings suggest that important species-dependent differences in phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a occur. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve.',\n",

              "  \"Post-surgical outcome for epilepsy associated with type I focal cortical dysplasia subtypes. Focal cortical dysplasias are a well-recognized cause of medically intractable seizures. The clinical relevance of certain subgroups of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification scheme remains to be determined. The aim of the present work is to assess the effect of the focal cortical dysplasia type Ib and Ic histologic subtypes on surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency. This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias. We retrospectively reviewed 91 focal cortical dysplasia patients (55% female; median age: 19 years (interquartile range 8-34); median seizure duration: 108 months (interquartile range 36-204)) with chronic epilepsy who underwent surgery. We compared the pathological subtypes, evaluating the patients' post-surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency according to the Engel's classification and the ILAE outcome classification. Both the ILAE classification scheme and Palmini et al classification scheme were utilized to classify the histologic subtype. Using χ(2) and Fisher's exact tests, we compared the post-surgical outcomes among these groups. Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB. After surgery, 44 patients (48%) were seizure-free. Crude analysis revealed no significant difference between patients with subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I concerning postoperative outcome according to the Engel and ILAE scoring systems on seizure frequency. Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB). In isolation, the histologic subtype of focal cortical dysplasia type I does not appear predictive of postoperative outcome.\",\n",
              "  \"Patterns of p73 N-terminal isoform expression and p53 status have prognostic value in gynecological cancers. The goal of this study was to determine whether patterns of expression profiles of p73 isoforms and of p53 mutational status are useful combinatorial biomarkers for predicting outcome in a gynecological cancer cohort. This is the first such study using matched tumor/normal tissue pairs from each patient. The median follow-up was over two years. The expression of all 5 N-terminal isoforms (TAp73, DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ex2p73 and Ex2/3p73) was measured by real-time RT-PCR and p53 status was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. TAp73, DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73 were significantly upregulated in tumors. Surprisingly, their range of overexpression was age-dependent, with the highest differences delta (tumor-normal) in the youngest age group. Correction of this age effect was important in further survival correlations. We used all 6 variables (five p73 isoform levels plus p53 status) as input into a principal component analysis with Varimax rotation (VrPCA) to filter out noise from non-disease related individual variability of p73 levels. Rationally selected and individually weighted principal components from each patient were then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict clinical outcome. This SVM algorithm was able to predict correct outcome in 30 of the 35 patients. We use here a mathematical tool for pattern recognition that has been commonly used in e.g. microarray data mining and apply it for the first time in a prognostic model.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical prediction rule to identify patients who can be safely discharged one hour after the administration of naloxone for presumed opioid overdose. METHODS: Patients who received naloxone for known or presumed opioid overdose were formally evaluated one hour later for multiple potential predictor variables. Patients were classified into two groups: those with adverse events within 24 hours and those without. Using classification and regression tree methodology, a decision rule was developed to predict safe discharge. RESULTS: Clinical findings from 573 patients allowed us to develop a clinical prediction rule with a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI = 96% to 100%) and a specificity of 40% (95% CI = 36% to 45%). Patients with presumed opioid overdose can be safely discharged one hour after naloxone administration if they: 1) can mobilize as usual; 2) have oxygen saturation on room air of >92%; 3) have a respiratory rate >10 breaths/min and <20 breaths/min; 4) have a temperature of >35.0 degrees C and <37.5 degrees C; 5) have a heart rate >50 beats/min and <100 beats/min; and 6) have a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. CONCLUSIONS: This prediction rule for safe early discharge of patients with presumed opioid overdose performs well in this derivation set but requires validation followed by confirmation of safe implementation.',\n",
              "  \"Stress responses in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L). XXII. cDNA cloning and characterization of an elicitor-inducible isoflavone 7-O-methyltransferase. Medicarpin, the major phytoalexin in alfalfa, is synthesized via the isoflavonoid branch of phenylpropanoid metabolism. The methyl group at the 9 position of medicarpin is generally accepted to arise via the methylation of the 4' position (B-ring) of daidzein. Surprisingly, the isoflavone-O-methyltransferase (IOMT), which is induced along with other enzymes involved in medicarpin biosynthesis, methylates the A-ring 7-hydroxyl group of daidzein in vitro, a reaction that probably does not occur in vivo. Utilizing internal amino acid sequence information from purified alfalfa IOMT, we have isolated three full-length IOMT cDNA clones. A search of the protein databases revealed sequence similarities to O-methyltransferases from various sources. The highest match (50.5% identity) was found between IOMT8 and 6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-O-methyltransferase from Pisum sativum. The molecular weight of alfalfa IOMT expressed in Escherichia coli was similar to that of purified IOMT from alfalfa cell cultures (41 kDa by SDS-PAGE). The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the O-methylation of A-ring hydroxyl group(s) of isoflavones, and could also methylate the pterocarpan (+) 6a-hydroxymaackiain. Alfalfa contains multiple IOMT genes, and closely related sequences are present in the genomes of chickpea and cowpea, species that also produce B-ring methylated isoflavonoids in vivo. Northern blot analysis indicated that IOMT transcripts are rapidly induced following elicitation, prior to the increase in IOMT activity and medicarpin accumulation. The possible role of the isoflavone 7-OMT in the synthesis of formononetin in vivo is discussed.\",\n",
              "  'A genetic risk factor for low serum ferritin levels in Danish blood donors. BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is a frequent side effect of blood donation. In recent years, several studies have described genetic variants associated with iron concentrations. However, the impact of these variants on iron levels is unknown in blood donors. Knowledge of genetic variants that predispose donors to iron deficiency would allow bleeding frequency and iron supplementation to be tailored to the individual donor. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The genotypes of five specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes that have been previously associated with iron status and/or restless leg syndrome (RLS) were investigated in two groups of female blood donors. The first group had low iron stores (serum ferritin < 12 µg/L, n = 657), and the second group had normal to high iron stores (serum ferritin > 30 µg/L, n = 645). Genotype distribution for each of the SNPs was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Homozygosity for the T-allele of BTBD9 rs9296249 was associated with lower serum ferritin. The odds ratio for low serum ferritin was 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.77; p = 0.03) when comparing donors with the TT genotype with donors with the CT genotype. CONCLUSION: A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin. This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors.',\n",
              "  'Heterogeneity of genomes: measures and values. Genomic homogeneity is investigated for a broad base of DNA sequences in terms of dinucleotide relative abundance distances (abbreviated delta-distances) and of oligonucleotide compositional extremes. It is shown that delta-distances between different genomic sequences in the same species are low, only about 2 or 3 times the distance found in random DNA, and are generally smaller than the between-species delta-distances. Extremes in short oligonucleotides include underrepresentation of TpA and overrepresentation of GpC in most temperate bacteriophage sequences; underrepresentation of CTAG in most eubacterial genomes; underrepresentation of GATC in most bacteriophage; CpG suppression in vertebrates, in all animal mitochondrial genomes, and in many thermophilic bacterial sequences; and overrepresentation of GpG/CpC in all animal mitochondrial sets and chloroplast genomes. Interpretations center on DNA structures (dinucleotide stacking energies, DNA curvature and superhelicity, nucleosome organization), context-dependent mutational events, methylation effects, and processes of replication and repair.',\n",

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are significantly associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, and studies using interventions that lower LDL-C levels have been shown to reduce the risk of ASCVD events and mortality. Statin treatment is the current first-line therapy for lowering LDL-C and reducing ASCVD risk. However, many patients are still unable to reach recommended LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, including evolocumab (previously AMG 145), dramatically lowered LDL-C in phase 2 clinical trials when administered alone or in combination with a statin. The aim of this phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of subcutaneous evolocumab (vs placebo) administered every 2 weeks or every month in combination with a statin in patients with hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. This study will also provide comparative efficacy, safety, and tolerability data between evolocumab and ezetimibe when added to background atorvastatin therapy.',\n",

The identification of the alpha-synuclein gene on chromosome 4q as a locus for familial Lewy-body parkinsonism and of alpha-synuclein as a component of Lewy bodies has heralded a new era in the study of Parkinson's disease. We have identified a large family with Lewy body parkinsonism linked to a novel locus on chromosome 4p15 that does not have a mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene. Here we report the clinical and neuropathological findings in an individual from this family and describe unusual high molecular weight alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive proteins in brain homogenates from brain regions with the most marked neuropathology. Distinctive histopathology was revealed with alpha-synuclein immunostaining, including pleomorphic Lewy bodies, synuclein-positive glial inclusions and widespread, severe neuritic dystrophy. We also discuss the relationship of this familial disorder to a Lewy body disease clinical spectrum, ranging from Parkinson's disease to dementia with psychosis.\",\n",

The BCR/ABL gene fusion, the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is generated in 2-10% of patients by a variant Ph translocation involving 9q34, 22q11.2, and one or more additional genomic regions. The objective of this study was the characterization by conventional and molecular cytogenetics of complex variant Ph translocations present at diagnosis. FISH studies were performed in 7 cases using the LSI BCR/ABL ES probe allowing the detection of the fusion BCR/ABL gene on the Ph chromosome in all of them and 9q34 deletions in 2 cases. Three cryptic complex rearrangements were detected by FISH studies. The third and the fourth chromosome regions involved in the 8 complex variant translocations were: 1q21, 1p36, 5q31, 11q13, 12q13, 12p13, and 20q12. In conclusion, FISH studies have been useful in the detection of the BCR/ABL rearrangements and 9q34 deletions, and to identify complex rearrangements that differ from the ones previously established by conventional cytogenetics.',\n",

Although radiological findings of cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome) are well known, there is no systematic study about the gender and the affected side in this syndrome. Brain images in 26 patients (mean aged 11) with cerebral hemiatrophy were retrospectively reviewed. Nineteen patients (73.5%) were male and seven patients (26.5%) were female. Left hemisphere involvement was seen in 18 patients (69.2%) and right hemisphere involvement was seen in eight patients (30.8%). We conclude that male gender and left side involvement are frequent in cerebral hemiatrophy disease.',\n",
              "  'In vitro effects of STI 571-containing drug combinations on the growth of Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. BACKGROUND: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a molecular aberration, a fusion BCR-ABL gene encoding for aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, which is crucial in the pathogenesis of CML. In vitro, inhibition of BCR-ABL protein tyrosine kinase activity by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (STI571; formerly CGP57148B), successfully suppressed proliferation/survival of the BCR-ABL positive clones. In clinical studies, hematologic and cytogenetic remissions have been achieved in most patients with chronic phase CML; in accelerated and blastic phases of CML, STI571 appeared less effective. In the current study, the authors tested combinations of STI571 and cytarabine and homoharringtonine (HHT), drugs with documented activity in CML. METHODS: The single agents and their combinations were studied for in vitro effect on proliferation of BCR-ABL positive cell lines KBM5 and KBM7 by 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5 diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay and on primary patient-derived BCR-ABL cells by clonogenic assays. The in vitro additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects of cytarabine and HHT with STI571 were then investigated by computer-assisted analysis using the CalcuSyn software. RESULTS: STI571 consistently suppressed BCR-ABL positive cell proliferation with a dose-effect correlation. In the model system used, STI571/cytarabine and STI571/HHT combinations were more effective in inhibiting KBM5 and KBM7 cell growth than each drug as single agent. These results were also verified in primary CML-derived clonogenic cells in semisolid cultures. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental system, our studies documented additive or synergistic effects with STI571 plus cytarabine or HHT, supporting the future use of STI571 combinations in clinical trials in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.',\n",
              "  'JTV-519, a novel cardioprotective agent, improves the contractile recovery after ischaemia-reperfusion in coronary perfused guinea-pig ventricular muscles. A newly synthesized benzothiazepine derivative, JTV-519 (JT) has been reported to be cardioprotective. However, the precise mechanism underlying the cardioprotective effect of this drug is unknown. Coronary-perfused guinea-pig ventricular muscles were subjected to 20-min no-flow ischaemia followed by 60-min reperfusion (I/R). I/R significantly decreased the contraction in untreated preparations (control group, 34+/-4% of baseline value, n=6). Brief administration of JT (1.0 microM) prior to ischaemia significantly improved the postischaemic contractile recovery (63+/-5% of baseline value, n=4), as compared to the control group. JT (1.0 microM) slightly prolonged action potential duration before ischaemia and induced conduction disturbance (2 : 1 block) after the initiation of ischaemia. The cardioprotective effect of JT was antagonized by chelerythrine (CH, 5.0 microM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) or by 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD, 400 microM), an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels. These results suggest that the protective effect of JT is due to the opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels, which, in turn, is linked to PKC activation.',\n",
              "  'Whole-exome sequencing to identify novel somatic mutations in squamous cell lung cancers. Squamous cell lung cancer is a major histotype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is distinct from lung adenocarcinoma. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify novel non-synonymous somatic mutations in squamous cell lung cancer. We identified 101 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) including 77 non-synonymous SNVs (67 missense and 10 nonsense mutations) and 11 INDELs causing frameshifts. We also found four SNVs located within splicing sites. We verified 62 of the SNVs (51 missense, 10 nonsense and 1 splicing-site mutation) and 10 of the INDELs as somatic mutations in lung cancer tissue. Sixteen of the mutated genes were also mutated in at least one patient with a different type of lung cancer in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutation in Cancer (COSMIC) database. Four genes (LPHN2, TP53, MYH2 and TGM2) were mutated in approximately 10% of the samples in the COSMIC database. We identified two missense mutations in C10orf137 and MS4A3 that also occurred in other solid-tumor tissues in the COSMIC database. We found another somatic mutation in EP300 that was mutated in 4.2% of the 2,020 solid-tumor samples in the COSMIC database. Taken together, our results implicate TP53, EP300, LPHN2, C10orf137, MYH2, TGM2 and MS4A3 as potential driver genes of squamous cell lung cancer.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are associated with the responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although various methods for detecting EGFR gene mutations have been developed, they have several disadvantages. We attempted to establish a new method for the detection of EGFR gene mutations with the use of paraffin-embedded samples. METHODS: The detections of T790M mutations in exon 20 and L858R mutations in exon 21 are based on the principle of allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We also designed PCR primers that enable to detect all types of deletions in exon 19. We assessed the basic performance efficiency of this method, and to confirm its clinical applicability, we performed PCR using DNA extracted from 66 tissue sections that were obtained from patients with NSCLC and embedded in paraffin. RESULTS: The sensitivity of this method for the detection of deletions or mutations was as low as 0.5%. In the 66 subjects whose samples were analyzed, we detected the following deletions and mutations in the EGFR gene: 11 deletions in exon 19, 8 L858R mutations, and 1 double mutation of L858R and T790M. CONCLUSION: The present method is sensitive and specific for the detection of deletions and mutations in the EGFR gene and is thus suitable for use in laboratory tests.',\n",
              "  'Monitoring minimal residual disease and controlling drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukaemia patients in treatment with imatinib as a guide to clinical management. Imatinib mesylate, binding to the inactive conformation of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase and suppressing the Ph chromosome positive clone, has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients. Given the high rates of clinical and cytogenetic remission achieved, the molecular monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript levels by RT-qPCR has become always more important to assess minimal residual disease. Recently, recommendations for harmonizing current methodologies for detecting and measuring BCR-ABL transcripts in CML patients have been suggested. Studies of imatinib-treated patients have determined that the BCR-ABL levels measured early in therapy may predict durable cytogenetic remission and in turn prolonged progression free-survival or acquisition of resistance. The major mechanism of imatinib resistance is clonal expansion of leukaemia cells with mutations in the Bcr-Abl fusion tyrosine kinase. The early reduction of such mutations may allow timely treatment intervention to prevent or overcome resistance. We review current trends in the management of chronic myeloid leukaemia patients undergoing treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.',\n",

BACKGROUND: The treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has resulted in few durable remissions. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg. RESULTS: Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma, including patients with high-risk genetic lesions.

              "  'Breakpoint characterization of a novel NF1 multiexonic deletion: a case showing expression of the mutated allele. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disease caused by haploinsufficiency of the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene. Different pathogenetic mechanisms have been identified, with the majority (95%) causing intragenic lesions. Single or multiexon NF1 copy number changes occur in about 2% of patients, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind these intragenic deletions. We report here on the molecular characterization of a novel NF1 multiexonic deletion. The application of a multidisciplinary approach including multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, allelic segregation analysis, and fluorescent in situ hybridization allowed us to map the breakpoints in IVS27b and IVS48. Furthermore, the breakpoint junction was characterized by sequencing. Using bioinformatic analysis, we identified some recombinogenic motifs in close proximity to the centromeric and telomeric breakpoints and predicted the presence of a mutated messenger ribonucleic acid, which was deleted between exons 28 and 48 and encodes a neurofibromin that lacks some domains essential for its function. Through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the expression of the mutated allele was verified, showing the junction between exons 27b and 49 and, as expected, was not subjected to nonsense-mediated decay. Multiexonic deletions represent 2% of NF1 mutations, and until now, the breakpoint has been identified in only a few cases. The fine characterization of multiexonic deletions broadens the mutational repertoire of the NF1 gene, allowing for the identification of different pathogenetic mechanisms causing NF1.',\n",

Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is characterized by early-onset carcinogenesis involving multiple tumor types and shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Approximately 70% of LFS cases are due to germline mutations in the TP53 gene on chromosome 17p13.1. Mutations have also been found in the CHEK2 gene on chromosome 22q11, and others have been mapped to chromosome 11q23. While characterizing an LFS family with a documented defect in TP53, we found one family member who developed bilateral breast cancer at age 37 yet was homozygous for wild-type TP53. Her mother also developed early-onset primary bilateral breast cancer, and a sister had unilateral breast cancer and a soft tissue sarcoma. Cytogenetic analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization of a primary skin fibroblast cell line revealed that the patient had a novel balanced reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 11 and 15: t(11;15)(q23;q15). This translocation was not present in a primary skin fibroblast cell line from a brother with neuroblastoma, who was heterozygous for the TP53 mutation. There was no evidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in either the patient or her mother, although a nephew did develop leukemia and died in childhood. These data may implicate the region at breakpoint 11q23 and/or 15q15 as playing a significant role in predisposition to breast cancer development.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with TP53 mutations is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who underwent genetic testing for suspected germline TP53 mutations and who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011. The pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation (cases) were compared with those testing negative (controls). RESULTS: Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). Among patients with a mutation, 70% had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the control group (P = .87). After adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, having a HER2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a germline TP53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). For each yearly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a TP53 mutation of 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. If confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating HER2-targeted therapies, and elucidate some of the molecular pathways involved in breast cancer.',\n",

PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, nonsteroidal, reversible, selective 17,20-lyase inhibitor. This study examined orteronel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study, 1,099 men were randomly assigned in a 2:1 schedule to receive orteronel 400 mg plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily or placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily, stratified by region (Europe, North America [NA], and non-Europe/NA) and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form worst pain score. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Key secondary end points (radiographic progression-free survival [rPFS], > 50% decrease of prostate-specific antigen [PSA50], and pain response at 12 weeks) were to undergo statistical testing only if the primary end point analysis was significant. RESULTS: The study was unblinded after crossing a prespecified OS futility boundary. The median OS was 17.0 months versus 15.2 months with orteronel-prednisone versus placebo-prednisone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.886; 95% CI, 0.739 to 1.062; P = .190). Improved rPFS was observed with orteronel-prednisone (median, 8.3 v 5.7 months; HR, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.653 to 0.885; P < .001). Orteronel-prednisone showed advantages over placebo-prednisone in PSA50 rate (25% v 10%, P < .001) and time to PSA progression (median, 5.5 v 2.9 months, P < .001) but not pain response rate (12% v 9%; P = .128). Adverse events (all grades) were generally more frequent with orteronel-prednisone, including nausea (42% v 26%), vomiting (36% v 17%), fatigue (29% v 23%), and increased amylase (14% v 2%). CONCLUSION: Our study did not meet the primary end point of OS. Longer rPFS and a higher PSA50 rate with orteronel-prednisone indicate antitumor activity.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of orexin receptor antagonism as a novel approach to treating insomnia. METHODS: We evaluated suvorexant, an orexin receptor antagonist, for treating patients with primary insomnia in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period (4 weeks per period) crossover polysomnography study. Patients received suvorexant (10 mg [n = 62], 20 mg [n = 61], 40 mg [n = 59], or 80 mg [n = 61]) in one period and placebo (n = 249) in the other. Polysomnography was performed on night 1 and at the end of week 4 of each period. The coprimary efficacy end points were sleep efficiency on night 1 and end of week 4. Secondary end points were wake after sleep onset and latency to persistent sleep. RESULTS: Suvorexant showed significant (p values <0.01) dose-related improvements vs placebo on the coprimary end points of sleep efficiency at night 1 and end of week 4. Dose-related effects were also observed for sleep induction (latency to persistent sleep) and maintenance (wake after sleep onset). Suvorexant was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that orexin receptor antagonism offers a novel approach to treating insomnia. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that suvorexant improves sleep efficiency over 4 weeks in nonelderly adult patients with primary insomnia.',\n",

Netherton syndrome (NS) is a serious inherited skin disorder caused by mutations in the gene SPINK5 (serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 5) which encodes for a serine protease inhibitor LEKTI (lymphoepithelial Kazal type-related inhibitor). Patients with NS have defective keratinization, hair shaft defects, recurrent infections, atopy and a predisposition to skin malignancies. Historically, one in ten infants has died before their first birthday. Currently there are no proven treatments to cure this condition. A SIN-lentiviral vector encoding the codon optimized SPINK5 gene under the control of a 572bp element derived from the human involucrin promoter (INVO) can confer compartment specific LEKTI expression in NS keratinocytes with restoration of normal skin architecture.

The 55 S mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (referred to hereafter as \"mitoribosome\") is protein-rich, containing nearly twice as much protein as the Escherichia coli ribosome. In order to produce soluble mitochondrial proteins and protein-deficient subribosomal particles for use in functional and structural studies, the proteins of bovine mitoribosomes were extracted by washing in a series of buffers containing increasing concentrations of LiCl as the only chaotropic agent. LiCl disruption is used in order to preserve the solubilized proteins in a substantially \"native\" configuration. The extraction mixtures were characterized by sucrose density gradient analysis and the compositions of the stripped protein and residual pellet fractions were determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In order to analyze the behavior or individual proteins, the intensity of Coomassie blue stain for each protein was normalized against the intensity of stain for the same protein in a control sample. Buffers with 1, 2, and 4 M LiCl each extract a specific subset of mitoribosomal proteins, while another group of proteins remains in the residual pellet fraction. Although very few proteins are detected in only one condition, most proteins are specifically enriched in one fraction. This LiCl procedure, therefore, produces fractionated groups of mitoribosomal proteins which can be used directly as a source for those proteins in which they are enriched, or they can be used as a starting point in further purification procedures. In contrast to results with E. coli ribosomes, several mitoribosomal proteins remain core-associated, indicating a different structural organization in these ribosomes.',\n",

The blockage of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) at a DNA damage site on the transcribed strand triggers a transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR), which rapidly removes DNA damage on the transcribed strand of the expressed gene and allows the resumption of transcription. To analyze the effect of UV-induced DNA damage on transcription elongation, an in vitro transcription elongation system using pol II and oligo(dC)-tailed templates containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) or 6-4 photoproduct (6-4PP) at a specific site was employed. The results showed that pol II incorporated nucleotides opposite the CPD and 6-4PP and then stalled. Pol II formed a stable ternary complex consisting of pol II, the DNA damage template, and the nascent transcript. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy imaging revealed that pol II stalled at the damaged region. These findings may provide the basis for analysis of the initiation step of TCR.',\n",

RECENT FINDINGS: The molecular target of rapamycin plays a critical role in transducing proliferative signals mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and protein kinase B signaling pathways, principally by activating downstream protein kinases that are required for both ribosomal biosynthesis and translation of mRNAs of proteins that are essential for G1 to S phase traverse. By targeting the molecular target of rapamycin with high potency and specificity, the immunosuppressant and antiproliferative agent rapamycin inhibits signals required for cell cycle progression, cell growth, and proliferation. Both rapamycin and several rapamycin analogs with more favorable pharmaceutical properties have demonstrated impressive growth inhibitory effects against a broad range of human cancers in both preclinical and early clinical evaluations. SUMMARY: This review discusses recent findings regarding the principal mechanisms of action of the rapamycins, the potential utility of these agents as anticancer therapeutics, clinical results to date, and developmental challenges that lie ahead.',\n",
              "  'Cathepsin A regulates chaperone-mediated autophagy through cleavage of the lysosomal receptor. Protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) has a serine carboxypeptidase activity of unknown physiological function. We now demonstrate that this protease activity triggers the degradation of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a), a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Degradation of lamp2a is important because its level in the lysosomal membrane is a rate-limiting step of CMA. Cells defective in PPCA show reduced rates of lamp2a degradation, higher levels of lamp2a and higher rates of CMA. Restoration of PPCA protease activity increases rates of lamp2a degradation, reduces levels of lysosomal lamp2a and reduces rates of CMA. PPCA associates with lamp2a on the lysosomal membrane and cleaves lamp2a near the boundary between the luminal and transmembrane domains. In addition to the well-studied role of PPCA in targeting and protecting two lysosomal glycosidases, we have defined a role for the proteolytic activity of this multifunctional protein.',\n",
              "  'A phase 1 multiple-dose study of orteronel in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is a non-steroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor effect of orteronel with or without prednisolone in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 study in men with progressive and chemotherapy-naïve CRPC. Patients received orteronel orally at doses of 200-400 mg twice daily (BID) with or without oral prednisolone (5 mg BID). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed during Cycle 1 (28 days). Patients could continue study treatment until any of criteria for treatment discontinuation were met. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy was continued in patients without prior orchidectomy. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled and administered at least one dose of orteronel. No DLTs were reported during Cycle 1 in this study. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in all 15 patients. Most common AEs (>30%) were hyperlipasemia (47%), hyperamylasemia (40%), and constipation (33%). Acute pancreatitis (Grades 2 and 3) and pancreatitis (Grade 1) were complicated in three patients during the study. Dose-dependent increase in plasma orteronel concentrations was indicated over the 200-400 mg BID dose range. Prednisolone coadministered did not alter PK of orteronel. Serum testosterone was rapidly suppressed below the lower limit of quantification across all doses. Of 15 subjects, 13 achieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline in prostate-specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Orteronel at doses up to 400 mg BID was tolerable in Japanese CRPC patients. The present results support further evaluation of orteronel with or without prednisolone.',\n",
              "  'Epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation in non-small cell lung cancer using highly sensitive and fast TaqMan PCR assay. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been found in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with good clinical response to gefitinib therapy. A quick and sensitive method with large throughput is required to utilize the information to determine whether the molecular targeted therapy should be applied for the particular NSCLC patients. Using probes for the 13 different mutations including 11 that have already been reported, we have genotyped the EGFR mutation status in 94 NSCLC patients using the TaqMan PCR assay. We have also genotyped the EGFR mutations status in additional 182 NSCLC patients, as well as 63 gastric, 95 esophagus and 70 colon carcinoma patients. In 94 NSCLC samples, the result of the TaqMan PCR assay perfectly matched with that of the sequencing excluding one patient. In one sample in which no EGFR mutation was detected by direct sequencing, the TaqMan PCR assay detected a mutation. This patient was a gefitinib responder. In a serial dilution study, the assay could detect a mutant sample diluted in 1/10 with a wild-type sample. Of 182 NSCLC samples, 46 mutations were detected. EGFR mutation was significantly correlated with gender, smoking status, pathological subtypes, and differentiation of lung cancers. There was no mutation detected by the TaqMan PCR assay in gastric, esophagus and colon carcinomas. TaqMan PCR assay is a rapid and sensitive method of detection of EGFR mutations with high throughput, and may be useful to determine whether gefitinib should be offered for the treatment of NSCLC patients. The TaqMan PCR assay can offer us a complementary and confirmative test.',\n",

The Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac DNA transposon systems have recently been developed as tools for insertional mutagenesis. We have compared the chromosomal mobilization efficiency and insertion site preference of the two transposons mobilized from the same donor site in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells under conditions in which there were no selective constraints on the transposons' insertion sites. Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis. Although Sleeping Beauty had no detectable genomic bias with respect to insertions in genes or intergenic regions, both Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac transposons displayed preferential integration into actively transcribed loci.\",\n",
              "  'Genotype-phenotype correlations in nemaline myopathy caused by mutations in the genes for nebulin and skeletal muscle alpha-actin. We present comparisons of the clinical pictures in a series of 60 patients with nemaline myopathy in whom mutations had been identified in the genes for nebulin or skeletal muscle alpha-actin. In the patients with nebulin mutations, the typical form of nemaline myopathy predominated, while severe, mild or intermediate forms were less frequent. Autosomal recessive inheritance had been verified or appeared likely in all nebulin cases. In the patients with actin mutations, the severe form of nemaline myopathy was the most common, but some had the mild or typical form, and a few showed other associated features such as intranuclear rods or actin accumulation. Most cases were sporadic, but in addition there were instances of both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance, while two families showed mosaicism for dominant mutations. Although no specific phenotype was found to be associated with mutations in either gene, clinical and histological features together with pedigree data may be used in guiding mutation detection. Finding the causative mutation(s) determines the mode of inheritance and permits prenatal diagnosis if requested, but will not as such permit prognostication.',\n",
              "  'Giant-cell tumor of bone: treatment options and role of denosumab. Giant-cell tumor of bone is a rare, locally aggressive tumor that typically occurs in the bones of skeletally mature young adults in their second to fourth decades. Traditionally, surgery has been the mainstay of therapy for this disease, but the disease can recur even with optimal procedures. Furthermore, it may occur in locations where a surgical approach would be morbid. The maturation of the understanding of the role of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) in the pathophysiology of giant-cell tumor of bone has led to the use of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, in this disease. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration approved denosumab for use in patients with recurrent/unresectable/metastatic giant-cell tumor of bone or for patients in whom surgery would be morbid.',\n",
              "  'The cell biology of a novel chromosomal RNA: chromosome painting by XIST/Xist RNA initiates a remodeling cascade. X chromosome inactivation begins when a novel chromosomal RNA (cRNA) from the imprinted mouse Xist or human XIST locus coats or \"paints\" one X chromosome in cis and initiates a cascade of chromosome remodeling events. Molecular cytological studies have proven invaluable for understanding the distinctive cellular behavior of this singular RNA involved in chromosome structure and regulation. While the detailed mechanism of XIST/Xist (X-inactivation Specific Transcript) RNA function remains largely unknown, recent advances provide new insights into the complex cellular factors which impact the RNA\\'s localization to the chromosome, as well as the early events of chromosome remodeling that follow painting by Xist RNA. Because chromatin changes can be directly visualized on a silenced chromosome, X chromosome inactivation provides an advantageous model to investigate genome-wide heterochromatin formation and maintenance, with wide-ranging implications for normal cells and disease.',\n",
              "  'Ideal vial size for bortezomib: real-world data on waste and cost reduction in treatment of multiple myeloma in Brazil. OBJECTIVES: Single-size vials of drugs may be a source of waste and increase in treatment costs. Bortezomib, indicated for multiple myeloma (MM) treatment, is available in 3.5-mg vials, a quantity higher than the average dose commonly prescribed. This analysis aimed to demonstrate, through real-world data, which would be the optimal vial presentation for bortezomib in Brazil and quantify the reduction in medication waste related to this option. METHODS: From November 2007 to October 2009 all patients with MM treated with bortezomib were identified via the Evidências database. Analysis of prescribed, dispensed, and wasted doses, their costs and projections of the ideal vial size were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (mean body surface area of 1.73 m(2)) received 509 infusions in 131 cycles of treatment (average of 3.77 cycles per patient). The average dose prescribed was 2.1 mg per infusion (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97-2.26) with average waste of 39.5% of the vial content (95% CI 35.35-43.76). The mean waste per patient per day was 1.38 mg (95% CI 1.24-1.52). If a 3-mg vial were available, the average drug waste per patient per day would be 0.88 mg (95% CI 0.74-1.03) or 36.2% less. With a 2.5-mg vial the waste would be 1.05 mg (95% CI 0.81-1.29) or 23.9% less. If two presentations were available (2.5 mg and 0.5 mg), the waste would be 0.52 mg (95% CI 0.4-0.63) or 62.5% less. Considering the price of the different vials to be proportional to the original 3.5-mg vial, the cost would be also reduced by the same rates described above. CONCLUSIONS: A simple adjustment in vial size may reduce the waste of bortezomib by 36% to 62% and can also reduce the cost of treatment.',\n",
              "  \"Stress Responses in Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) : V. Constitutive and Elicitor-Induced Accumulation of Isoflavonoid Conjugates in Cell Suspension Cultures. The isoflavonoid conjugates medicarpin-3-O-glucoside-6''-O-malonate (MGM), afrormosin-7-O-glucoside (AG), and afrormosin-7-O-glucoside-6''-O-malonate (AGM) were isolated and characterized from cell suspension cultures of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), where they were the major constitutive secondary metabolites. They were also found in alfalfa roots but not in other parts of the plant. The phytoalexin medicarpin accumulated rapidly in suspension cultured cells treated with elicitor from Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, and this was subsequently accompanied by an increase in the levels of MGM. In contrast, net accumulation of afrormosin conjugates was not affected by elicitor treatment. Labeling studies with [(14)C]phenylalanine indicated that afrormosin conjugates were the major de novo synthesized isoflavonoid products in unelicited cells. During elicitation, [(14)C]phenylalanine was incorporated predominantly into medicarpin, although a significant proportion of the newly synthesized medicarpin was also conjugated. Treatment of (14)C-labeled, elicited cells with l-alpha-aminooxy-beta-phenylpropionic acid, a potent inhibitor of PAL activity in vivo, resulted in the initial appearance of labeled medicarpin of very low specific activity, suggesting that the phytoalexin could be released from a preformed conjugate under these conditions. Our data draw attention to the involvement of isoflavone hydroxylases during the constitutive and elicitor-induced accumulation of isoflavonoids and their conjugates in alfalfa cell cultures.\",\n",

Iron deficiency anemia is common in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its importance in supporting erythropoiesis is unquestioned especially in those patients treated with erythropoietin. Clinical symptomatology such as fatigability, cold intolerance, failure to concentrate and poor effort intolerance is often attributed to anemia or uremia. That iron deficiency, per se, can cause these symptoms is poorly recognized. Clinical and animal studies that support the benefits of iron supplementation, independent of increasing hemoglobin, such as those on immune function, physical performance, thermoregulation, cognition, and restless leg syndrome and aluminum absorption is the subject of this narrative review.',\n",
              "  \"Bruton's tyrosine kinase mediated signaling enhances leukemogenesis in a mouse model for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) signals from the B cell receptor (BCR) play a major role in disease development and progression. In this light, new therapies that specifically target signaling molecules downstream of the BCR continue to be developed. While first studies on the selective small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), demonstrated that Btk inhibition sensitizes CLL cells to apoptosis and alters their migratory behavior, these studies however did not address whether Btk-mediated signaling is involved in the process of CLL leukemogenesis. To investigate the requirement of Btk signaling for CLL development, we modulated Btk expression in the IgH.ETμ CLL mouse model, which is based on sporadic expression of the simian oncovirus SV40 T-antigen in mature B cells. To this end, we crossed IgH.ETμ mice on a Btk-deficient background or introduced a human Btk transgene (CD19-hBtk). Here we show that Btk deficiency fully abrogates CLL formation in IgH.ETμ mice, and that leukemias formed in Btk haplo-insufficient mice selectively expressed the wild-type Btk allele on their active X chromosome. Conversely, Btk overexpression accelerated CLL onset, increased mortality, and was associated with selection of non-stereotypical BCRs into CLL clones. Taken together, these data show that Btk expression represents an absolute prerequisite for CLL development and that Btk mediated signaling enhances leukemogenesis in mice. We therefore conclude that in CLL Btk expression levels set the threshold for malignant transformation.\",\n",
              "  'Lack of action of exogenously administered T3 on the fetal rat brain despite expression of the monocarboxylate transporter 8. Mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene (MCT8, SLC16A2) cause the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked syndrome of severe intellectual deficit and neurological impairment. Mct8 transports thyroid hormones (T4 and T3), and the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is likely caused by lack of T3 transport to neurons during critical periods of fetal brain development. To evaluate the role of Mct8 in thyroid hormone action in the fetal brain we administered T4 or T3 to thyroidectomized pregnant dams treated with methyl-mercapto-imidazol to produce maternal and fetal hypothyroidism. Gene expression was then measured in the fetal cerebral cortex. T4 increased Camk4, Sema3c, and Slc7a3 expression, but T3 was without effect. To investigate the cause for the lack of T3 action we analyzed the expression of organic anion transport polypeptide (Oatp14, Slco1c1), a T4 transporter, and Mct8 (Slc16a2), a T4 and T3 transporter, by confocal microscopy. Both proteins were present in the brain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier and in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. It is concluded that T4 from the maternal compartment influences gene expression in the fetal cerebral cortex, possibly after transport via organic anion transporter polypeptide and/or Mct8, and conversion to T3 in the astrocytes. On the other hand, T3 does not reach the target neurons despite the presence of Mct8. The data indicate that T4, through local deiodination, provides most T3 in the fetal rat brain. The role of Mct8 as a T3 transporter in the fetal rat brain is therefore uncertain.',\n",
              "  'Schwann cell involvement in the peripheral neuropathy of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. AIMS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited spinocerebellar ataxia caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats in the gene encoding ataxin-3. The clinical manifestations of SCA3 include peripheral neuropathy, which is an important cause of disability in a subset of patients. Although the loss of neurones in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) has been postulated to be the cause of this neuropathy, the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. METHODS: To clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of SCA3-associated peripheral neuropathy, we performed nerve conduction studies and histopathological analyses. Nerve conduction studies were carried out in 18 SCA3 patients. Immunohistochemical analyses of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves were performed in five SCA3 patients. We also employed immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy analyses with an anti-polyglutamine antibody. RESULTS: The mean sensory nerve action potentials of the SCA3 patients were half of the normal values. The motor conduction velocities were decreased, and the distal latencies were also significantly prolonged in the nerves studied relative to the those in normal controls. Histopathological analyses detected axonal sprouting and myelin thinning in all cases. Ataxin-3 aggregates were found in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells in all of the SCA3 patients examined but not in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the previously reported neuronopathy, the results of the present study indicate that Schwann cells are involved in the formation of the pathogenic intracytoplasmic ataxin-3 protein aggregates in patients with SCA3-associated neuropathy.',\n",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prevention of stroke and systemic emboli is paramount in the management of atrial fibrillation. Although warfarin is the predominant anticoagulant used in patients with atrial fibrillation, it has significant limitations that have impeded appropriate use of stroke prophylaxis in eligible patients with atrial fibrillation. Consequently, much research has been focused on finding an alternative to warfarin. We review the potential alternatives in development and evaluate the current evidence concerning their safety and efficacy. RECENT FINDINGS: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors are potentially well tolerated and effective replacements for warfarin. These agents do not require cofactors and offer selective inhibition at a critical step of amplification in the coagulation cascade. Multiple direct anti-factor Xa agents are currently undergoing evaluation in phase I, II, and III trials. Early results suggest that these novel anticoagulants have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with minimal-to-no requirements for therapeutic monitoring. Two direct factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation. The phase III trials of apixaban and rivaroxaban have completed enrollment and are in the follow-up phase. SUMMARY: Given the growing population of patients with atrial fibrillation, there is a great interest in finding new therapies for oral anticoagulation. The direct factor Xa inhibitors may offer several promising alternatives to warfarin therapy.',\n",
              "  'SERCA in genesis of arrhythmias: what we already know and what is new? This review mainly focuses on the structure, function of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) and its role in genesis of arrhythmias. SERCA is a membrane protein that belongs to the family of P-type ion translocating ATPases and pumps free cytosolic calcium into intracellular stores. Active transport of Ca2+ is achieved, according to the E1-E2 model, changing of SERCA structure by Ca2+. The affinity of Ca2+ -binding sites varies from high (E1) to low (E2). Three different SERCA genes were identified-SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3. SERCA is mainly represented by the SERCA2a isoform in the heart. In heart muscle, during systole, depolarization triggers the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and starts contraction. During diastole, muscle relaxation occurs as Ca2+ is again removed from cytosol, predominantly by accumulation into SR via the action of SERCA2a. The main regulator of SERCA2a is phospholamban and another regulator proteolipid of SERCA is sarcolipin. There are a lot of studies on the effect of decreased and/or increased SERCA activity in genesis of arrhythmia. Actually both decrease and increase of SERCA activity in the heart result in some pathological mechanisms such as heart failure and arrhythmia.',\n",
              "  'Ca2+ binding to site I of the cardiac Ca2+ pump is sufficient to dissociate phospholamban. Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca(2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+). Recent cross-linking studies have suggested that PLB binding and Ca(2+) binding to SERCA2a are mutually exclusive. PLB binds to the E2 conformation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, preventing formation of E1, the conformation that binds two Ca(2+) (at sites I and II) with high affinity and is required for ATP hydrolysis. Here we determined whether Ca(2+) binding to site I, site II, or both sites is sufficient to dissociate PLB from the Ca(2+) pump. Seven SERCA2a mutants with amino acid substitutions at Ca(2+)-binding site I (E770Q, T798A, and E907Q), site II (E309Q and N795A), or both sites (D799N and E309Q/E770Q) were made, and the effects of Ca(2+) on N30C-PLB cross-linking to Lys(328) of SERCA2a were measured. In agreement with earlier reports with the skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase, none of the SERCA2a mutants (except E907Q) hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of Ca(2+); however, all were phosphorylatable by P(i) to form E2P. Ca(2+) inhibition of E2P formation was observed only in SERCA2a mutants retaining site I. In cross-linking assays, strong cross-linking between N30C-PLB and each Ca(2+)-ATPase mutant was observed in the absence of Ca(2+). Importantly, however, micromolar Ca(2+) inhibited PLB cross-linking only to mutants retaining a functional Ca(2+)-binding site I. The dynamic equilibrium between Ca(2+) pumps and N30C-PLB was retained by all mutants, demonstrating normal regulation of cross-linking by ATP, thapsigargin, and anti-PLB antibody. From these results we conclude that site I is the key Ca(2+)-binding site regulating the physical association between PLB and SERCA2a.',\n",
              "  'Genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of sex differences in the brain and in neurological and psychiatric disease susceptibility. There are numerous examples of sex differences in brain and behavior and in susceptibility to a broad range of brain diseases. For example, gene expression is sexually dimorphic during brain development, adult life, and aging. These differences are orchestrated by the interplay between genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin these differences have not been fully elucidated. Because recent studies have highlighted the key roles played by epigenetic processes in regulating gene expression and mediating brain form and function, this chapter reviews emerging evidence that shows how epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are responsible for promoting sexual dimorphism in the brain. Differential profiles of DNA methylation and histone modifications are found in dimorphic brain regions such as the hypothalamus as a result of sex hormone exposure during developmental critical periods. The elaboration of specific epigenetic marks is also linked with regulating sex hormone signaling pathways later in life. Furthermore, the expression and function of epigenetic factors such as the methyl-CpG-binding protein, MeCP2, and the histone-modifying enzymes, UTX and UTY, are sexually dimorphic in the brain. ncRNAs are also implicated in promoting sex differences. For example, X inactivation-specific transcript (XIST) is a long ncRNA that mediates X chromosome inactivation, a seminal developmental process that is particularly important in brain. These observations imply that understanding epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate dimorphic gene expression and function, is necessary for developing a more comprehensive view of sex differences in brain. These emerging findings also suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are, in part, responsible for the differential susceptibility between males and females that is characteristic of a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders.',\n",
              "  'p73 plays a role in erythroid differentiation through GATA1 induction. The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. Although TAp73alpha and -beta proteins are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation, DeltaNp73 acts in many cell types as a dominant-negative repressor of p53 and TAp73. It has been proposed that p73 is involved in myeloid differentiation, and its altered expression is involved in leukemic degeneration. However, there is little evidence as to which p73 variants (TA or DeltaN) are expressed during differentiation and whether specific p73 isoforms have the capacity to induce, or hinder, this differentiation in leukemia cells. In this study we identify GATA1 as a direct transcriptional target of TAp73alpha. Furthermore, TAp73alpha induces GATA1 activity, and it is required for erythroid differentiation. Additionally, we describe a functional cooperation between TAp73 and DeltaNp73 in the context of erythroid differentiation in human myeloid cells, K562 and UT-7. Moreover, the impaired expression of GATA1 and other erythroid genes in the liver of p73KO embryos, together with the moderated anemia observed in p73KO young mice, suggests a physiological role for TP73 in erythropoiesis.',\n",
              "  'Loss of the intermembrane space protein Mgm1/OPA1 induces swelling and localized constrictions along the lengths of mitochondria. Mgm1 is a member of the dynamin family of GTP-binding proteins. Mgm1 was first identified in yeast, where it affects mitochondrial morphology. The human homologue of Mgm1 is called OPA1. Mutations in the OPA1 gene are the prevailing cause of dominant optic atrophy, a hereditary disease in which progressive degeneration of the optic nerve can lead to blindness. Here we investigate the properties of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein in mammalian cells. We find that Mgm1/OPA1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it is tightly bound to the outer surface of the inner membrane. Overexpression of wild type or mutant forms of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein cause mitochondria to fragment and, in some cases, cluster near the nucleus, whereas the loss of protein caused by small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to dispersal of mitochondrial fragments throughout the cytosol. The cristae of these fragmented mitochondria are disorganized. At early time points after transfection with Mgm1/OPA1 siRNA, the mitochondria are not yet fragmented. Instead, the mitochondria swell and stretch, after which they form localized constrictions similar to the mitochondrial abnormalities observed during the early stages of apoptosis. These abnormalities might be the earliest effects of losing Mgm1/OPA1 protein.',\n",

A rare syndrome, Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome (DDMS), with a diagnostic conundrum, and the way it was solved is presented. A 13-year-old boy presented with recurrent seizures for the past 10 years. He had been treated with anticonvulsant medication which was satisfactory at first but later the seizures recurred. Recently, the frequency of the seizures increased with preictal dizziness and postictal drowsiness. Physical examination revealed mild left hemiparesis and left deviated gait irregularity. He was mentally alert but had not achieved all the developmental milestones as compared to normal child of his age. CT and MRI scan of the head showed hemiatrophic cerebral parenchyma with prominent sulci and encephalomalacia. 24-hour intensive video EEG monitoring revealed suppression of alpha rhythm and local slow wave activity on the side of the atrophic hemisphere. PET-CT showed highly functional left cerebral hemisphere and less functional right cerebral hemisphere. The patient underwent functional hemispherectomy under neurophysiological monitoring and the nonfunctional brain tissues were resected while selectively preserving the functional areas detected by fMRI and PET-CT scan. During follow up, the patient was seizure free as well as without difficulties in performing his daily activities and communications. Functional hemispherectomy for DDMS patient has a good prognosis.',\n",

Herein, we report the synthesis of carbon-13 and carbon-14 labeled empagliflozin. Carbon-13 labeled empagliflozin was prepared in five steps and in 34% overall chemical yield starting from the commercially available α-D-glucose-[(13)C6]. For the radiosynthesis, the carbon-14 atom was introduced in three different positions of the molecule. In the first synthesis, Carbon-14 D-(+)-gluconic acid δ-lactone was used to prepare specifically labeled empagliflozin in carbon-1 of the sugar moiety in four steps and in 19% overall radiochemical yield. Carbon-14 labeled empagliflozin with the radioactive atom in the benzylic position was obtained in eight steps and in 7% overall radiochemical yield. In the last synthesis carbon-14 uniformly labeled phenol was used to give [(14)C]empagliflozin in eight steps and in 18% overall radiochemical yield. In all these radiosyntheses, the specific activities of the final compounds were higher than 53 mCi/mmol, and the radiochemical purities were above 98.5%.',\n",
              "  'New evidence on the relationship between Microsporidia and Fungi: a genome-wide analysis by DarkHorse software. Microsporidia are a group of obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites that infect a wide variety of species, including humans. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a relationship between the Microsporidia and the Fungi. However, most results are based on the analysis of relatively few genes. DarkHorse analysis involves the transformation of BLAST results into a lineage probability index (LPI) value and allows for the comparison of genes for an entire genome with those of other genomes. Thus, we can see which genes from the microsporidia score most closely based on the LPI with other eukaryotic organisms. In this analysis, we calculated the LPI for each gene from the genomes of 7 Microsporidia, Antonospora locustae, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Nosema bombycis, Nosema ceranae, and Nematocida parisii, to analyze the genetic relationships between Microsporidia and other species. It was found that many (91%) genes were most closely correlated with genes from other microsporidial genomes and had the highest mean LPI (0.985), indicating a monophyletic origin of the Microsporidia. In a subsequent analysis, we excluded the other Microsporidia from the analysis to look for relationships before the divergence of Microsporidia, and found that 43% of the microsporidial genes scored highest with fungal genes, and a higher mean LPI was found with Fungi than with other kingdoms, suggesting that Microsporidia is closely related to Fungi at the genomic level. Microsporidial genes were functionally clustered based on the KOG (Eukaryotic COG) database, and the possible lineages for each gene family were discussed in concert with the DarkHorse results.',\n",
              "  'Atrial fibrillation in the 21st century: a current understanding of risk factors and primary prevention strategies. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide, and it has a significant effect on morbidity and mortality. It is a significant risk factor for stroke and peripheral embolization, and it has an effect on cardiac function. Despite widespread interest and extensive research on this topic, our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease process is still incomplete. As a result, there are no set primary preventive strategies in place apart from general cardiology risk factor prevention goals. It seems intuitive that a better understanding of the risk factors for AF would better prepare medical professionals to initially prevent or subsequently treat these patients. In this article, we discuss widely established risk factors for AF and explore newer risk factors currently being investigated that may have implications in the primary prevention of AF. For this review, we conducted a search of PubMed and used the following search terms (or a combination of terms): atrial fibrillation, metabolic syndrome, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, exercise toxicity, alcohol abuse, and treatment. We also used additional articles that were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles to examine the published evidence for the risk factors of AF.',\n",
              "  'Different mechanisms may generate sustained hypertonic and rhythmic bursting muscle activity in idiopathic dystonia. Despite that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is emerging as the favored intervention for patients with medically intractable dystonia, the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are largely unclear. In eight patients with primary dystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EMG) activity of the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the globus pallidus electrodes. In 5 dystonic patients with mobile involuntary movements, rhythmic EMG bursts in the contralateral muscles were coherent with the oscillations in the pallidal LFPs at the burst frequency. In contrast, no significant coherence was seen between EMG and LFPs either for the sustained activity separated out from the compound EMGs in those 5 cases, or in the EMGs in 3 other cases without mobile involuntary movements and rhythmic EMG bursts. In comparison with the resting condition, in both active and passive movements, significant modulation in the GPi LFPs was seen in the range of 8-16 Hz. The finding of significant coherence between GPi oscillations and rhythmic EMG bursts but not sustained tonic EMG activity suggests that the synchronized pallidal activity may be directly related to the rhythmic involuntary movements. In contrast, the sustained hypertonic muscle activity may be represented by less synchronized activity in the pallidum. Thus, the pallidum may play different roles in generating different components of the dystonic symptom complex.',\n",
              "  'Genomic organization of the human kallikrein gene family on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases with diverse physiological functions. Recently, growing evidence indicates that many kallikrein genes are involved in malignancy. In rodents, kallikreins are encoded by a large multigene family, but in humans only three kallikreins were thought to exist. Based on the homology between the human and rodent kallikrein loci, we studied a 300 kb region of genomic sequences around the putative KLK1 gene locus on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. By using linear sequence information, restriction analysis, end sequencing, PCR and blotting techniques, as well as bioinformatic approaches, we were able to construct the first detailed map of the human kallikrein gene family. Comparative analysis of genes located in this area, provides strong evidence that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is considerably larger than previously thought, containing at least fifteen genes. We have established, for the first time, the common structural features that apply to all members of the expanded kallikrein multigene family. Our map specifies the distance between genes to one base pair accuracy, the relative location, and the direction of transcription of all 15 genes. Determination of the true size of the kallikrein family in humans is important for our understanding of the contribution of the kallikreins to human biology and pathophysiology.',\n",
              "  'A patient with Pendred syndrome whose goiter progressed with normal serum thyrotropin and iodine organification. Biallelic mutations of SLC26A4 (encoding pendrin) cause Pendred syndrome (PS), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with deafness and goiter. The mechanism underlying the development of the goiter is unknown. Here, we report clinical and molecular findings of a patient with PS. This 27-year-old woman was born to nonconsanguineous healthy parents. She was seen at our hospital due to hearing loss at age 3 years, and subsequently developed goiter at age 10 years. From age 15 years, her thyroid gland showed progressive enlargement accompanied by elevation of serum thyroglobulin reaching 10-fold the normal amount. Thyroidal iodine uptake was also increased during goiter progression ((123)I uptake at 24 hr: 20.2% at age 17 years; 69.4% at age 24 years; reference, 8-40), while serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels and iodine organification (examined by the perchrolate or thiocyanate discharge test) remained normal. We sequenced SLC26A4 using standard PCR-based technique, and found one novel (p.T537P) and one recurrent (p.H723R) mutations in a compound heterozygous state. Expression experiments using COS-7 cells showed that the two mutants were entrapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and were poorly localized at the plasma membrane. In summary, a molecularly confirmed PS patient showed goiter progression accompanied by elevated serum thyroglobulin and increased thyroidal iodine uptake, but normal serum TSH levels and normal iodine organification. This implies that some pendrin mutations may involve direct stimulation of thyroid cell proliferation with no TSH hyperstimulation and no iodine organification defect.',\n",
              "  'Narcolepsy and H1N1 vaccination: a link? PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A number of European countries have reported a dramatic increase in the rates of childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy in children immunized with a split-virion adjuvanted swine flu vaccine. Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these epidemiological studies and possible neuroimmunological mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: Initial concerns of a 13-fold increased relative risk of narcolepsy were raised by the Scandinavian health protection agencies in 2010. Subsequent retrospective studies support these findings in Canada, France, Ireland, England and Denmark. The cases are predominantly young children who present with severe and rapid onset of cataplexy as well as narcolepsy often within a few weeks of vaccination. The proposed mechanism for postvaccination narcolepsy is one in which an environmental trigger causes or enhances an antibody-mediated autoimmune response in patients with a preexisting genetic susceptibility. However, there have not yet been any reports of specific autoimmunity, either antibody or T-cell-mediated. SUMMARY: There is a strong association between narcolepsy and H1N1 vaccination. However, whether this reflects a true increase in affected individuals or a hastening of disease onset in individuals who would otherwise have developed narcolepsy later will become clear in the coming years. The pathological explanation of this association and narcolepsy is likely to be autoimmune, although supportive evidence is lacking.Video abstract available: See the Video Supplementary Digital Content 1 (http://links.lww.com/COPM/A9).',\n",
              "  'Neuropathology of pediatric brain tumors. Pediatric central nervous system neoplasms include a spectrum of both glial and nonglial tumors that differ significantly in location and biological behavior from those of adults. Brain tumors in infants and children most often arise from central neuroepithelial tissue, whereas a significant number of adult tumors arise from central nervous system coverings (e.g., meningioma), adjacent tissue (e.g., pituitary adenoma), or metastases. Most adult brain tumors are supratentorial malignant gliomas, whereas the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor is the cerebellar primitive neuroectodermal tumor (medulloblastoma). This article reviews neuropathological characteristics of the more common pediatric brain tumors. Entities, such as the brainstem glioma, and less common neoplasms like the desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma and the central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor are reviewed because they occur almost exclusively in children. Known cytogenetic and molecular characteristics of childhood brain tumors are also reviewed.',\n",
              "  'Characterisation of sensory abnormalities observed in an animal model of multiple sclerosis: a behavioural and pharmacological study. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease, associated, in 50-80% of patients, with persistent pain. While the type of pain that affects these patients is being more documented, the mechanisms underlying this pathology are still poorly understood and animal models of such chronic pain associated with MS are required. The aim of our study was to characterize the sensory abnormalities and in particular the clinical signs linked to persistent pain in two models of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the rat. This behavioural characterization tested several sensory modalities such as mechanical and thermal (heat/cold) hyperalgesia or allodynia and explored some of these modalities on two different extremities: the hindpaws and the tail. Our study showed that while one of the model produced more robust motor impairment, animals of both models suffer from mechanical hyperalgesia and thermal allodynia to cold, both at the level of the tail and the hindpaws. While the time-course changes of some of these modalities are shifted in the time between the two models, they represent good models of the sensory abnormalities experienced by MS patients. The second part of our study aimed at characterizing from a pharmacological point of view the most robust model (\"EAE+Cyclosporine\") and showed that Gabapentin, Duloxetine and Tramadol partially relieved some of the clinical signs. Our results suggest that the model \"EAE+Cyclosporine\" in the rat is a good model of chronic sensory abnormalities observed in MS patients both from a behavioural and pharmacological point of view.',\n",
              "  'Anti-ischemic effect of a novel cardioprotective agent, JTV519, is mediated through specific activation of delta-isoform of protein kinase C in rat ventricular myocardium. BACKGROUND: A new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV519, has a strong protective effect against Ca(2+) overload-induced myocardial injury. We investigated the effect of JTV519 on ischemia/reperfusion injury in isolated rat hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: At 30 minutes of reperfusion after 30-minute global ischemia, the percent recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was improved, and the creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase leakage was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner when JTV519 was administered in the coronary perfusate both at 5 minutes before the induction of ischemia and at the time of reperfusion. The myocardial protective effect of JTV519 was completely blocked by pretreatment of the heart with GF109203X, a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. In contrast, the effect of JTV519 was not affected by alpha(1)-, A(1)-, and B(2)-receptor blockers that couple with PKC in the cardiomyocyte. Both immunofluorescence images and immunoblots of JTV519-treated left ventricular myocardium and isolated ventricular myocytes demonstrated that this agent induced concentration-dependent translocation of the delta-isoform but not the other isoforms of PKC to the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of cardioprotection by JTV519 against ischemia/reperfusion injury involves isozyme-specific PKC activation through a receptor-independent mechanism. This agent may provide a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of patients with acute coronary diseases via a subcellular mechanism mimicking ischemic preconditioning.',\n",
              "  'Effect of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist telcagepant in human cranial arteries. INTRODUCTION: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuronal messenger in intracranial sensory nerves and is considered to play a significant role in migraine pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect of the CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, on CGRP-induced cranial vasodilatation in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries. We also studied the expression of the CGRP receptor components in cranial arteries with immunocytochemistry. Concentration response curves to αCGRP were performed in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries in the absence or presence of telcagepant. Arterial slices were stained for RAMP1, CLR and actin in a double immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: In both arteries, we found that: (i) telcagepant was devoid of any contractile or relaxant effects per se; (ii) pretreatment with telcagepant antagonised the αCGRP-induced relaxation in a competitive manner; and (iii) immunohistochemistry revealed expression and co-localisation of CLR and RAMP1 in the smooth muscle cells in the media layer of both arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide morphological and functional data on the presence of CGRP receptors in cerebral and meningeal arteries, which illustrates a possible site of action of telcagepant in the treatment of migraine.',\n",
              "  'Is pulmonary arterial hypertension in neurofibromatosis type 1 secondary to a plexogenic arteriopathy? BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common disorder of dysregulated tissue growth secondary to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene NF1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with NF1 is hypothesized to be secondary to an underlying vasculopathy. METHODS: We describe the entity we term NF1-associated PAH (NF1-PAH) in four new patients and update the data on four previously published reports of patients with PAH and NF1. We performed genetic testing of the bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) gene, which mutated in 70% of patients with familial PAH and approximately 25% of patients with idiopathic PAH. We report, for the first time, pathologic findings in the autopsy-obtained lung of one patient with NF1-PAH. RESULTS: Patients with NF1-PAH have a generally poor long-term prognosis. In four patients, we observed the mosaic pattern of lung attenuation on a CT scan of the chest, a radiographic finding that can be consistent with an underlying vasculopathy. No mutations or rearrangements in the BMPR2 gene were found. We observed complex plexiform lesions in the one available autopsy specimen. Similar lesions are a hallmark of plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy and are associated with several severe types of PAH. (Plexiform lesions should not be confused with plexiform neurofibromas, which are distinctive tumors seen in NF1.) CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that NF1 should be considered as being \"associated with PAH as outlined in the Revised Clinical Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension. Understanding the mechanism of PAH in NF1 may inform the pathogenesis of PAH, NF1-PAH itself, and other NF1-associated vasculopathies. The pulmonary vasculature should now be included among the arterial beds affected by NF1 vasculopathy.',\n",
              "  \"Donohue syndrome in a neonate with homozygous deletion of exon 3 of the insulin receptor gene. Donohue syndrome describes the clinical consequences of the most severe genetic loss of insulin receptor function. The cardinal features are severe linear growth impairment pre- and postnatally with abnormal glucose metabolism and a characteristic pattern of soft tissue overgrowth. We report a 5 day old neonate with refractory hyperglycemia and paradoxical hypoglycemia, severe intrauterine growth retardation, typical 'elfin' facies (hypertrichosis, large and low-set ears, broad nasal tip, flared nares, thick lips), reduced subcutaneous fat, distended abdomen, and enlarged external genitalia and nipples. Fasting serum insulin and C-peptide were severely elevated at >2,100 pmol/l and >2,331 pmol/l, respectively. In addition, hepatic, ovarian and renal enlargement was demonstrated by ultrasonography. The neonate died within two months secondary to hypoglycemia. Diplex PCR analysis of the insulin receptor gene revealed the neonate to be homozygous for deletion of exon 3. Both parents were heterozygous for this deletion but were metabolically healthy. As such a deletion has previously been reported in Israel, we suggest that it may show a founder effect in the Middle East.\",\n",
              "  'Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) coordinates pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell metabolism, proliferation, and survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension. BACKGROUND: Enhanced proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and metabolic shift to glycolysis of pulmonary arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (PAVSMCs) are key pathophysiological components of pulmonary vascular remodeling in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The role of the distinct mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes mTORC1 (mTOR-Raptor) and mTORC2 (mTOR-Rictor) in PAVSMC proliferation and survival in PAH and their therapeutic relevance are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses revealed that mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways are markedly upregulated in small remodeled pulmonary arteries and isolated distal PAVSMCs from subjects with idiopathic PAH that have increased ATP levels, proliferation, and survival that depend on glycolytic metabolism. Small interfering RNA- and pharmacology-based analysis showed that although both mTORC1 and mTORC2 contribute to proliferation, only mTORC2 is required for ATP generation and survival of idiopathic PAH PAVSMCs. mTORC2 downregulated the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase, which led to activation of mTORC1-S6 and increased proliferation, as well as a deficiency of the proapoptotic protein Bim and idiopathic PAH PAVSMC survival. NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) protein levels were increased in idiopathic PAH PAVSMCs, which was necessary for mTORC2 activation, proliferation, and survival. Nox4 levels and mTORC2 signaling were significantly upregulated in small pulmonary arteries from hypoxia-exposed rats at days 2 to 28 of hypoxia. Treatment with the mTOR kinase inhibitor PP242 at days 15 to 28 suppressed mTORC2 but not Nox4, induced smooth muscle-specific apoptosis in small pulmonary arteries, and reversed hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling in rats. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a novel mechanistic link of Nox4-dependent activation of mTORC2 via the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase to increased proliferation and survival of PAVSMCs in PAH, which suggests a new potential pathway for therapeutic interventions.',\n",
              "  'Small heat shock protein 20 interacts with protein phosphatase-1 and enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling. BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are known to enhance cell survival under various stress conditions. In the heart, the small Hsp20 has emerged as a key mediator of protection against apoptosis, remodeling, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover, Hsp20 has been implicated in modulation of cardiac contractility ex vivo. The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo role of Hsp20 in the heart and the mechanisms underlying its regulatory effects in calcium (Ca) cycling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hsp20 overexpression in intact animals resulted in significant enhancement of cardiac function, coupled with augmented Ca cycling and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load in isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with specific increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at both Ser16 and Thr17, relieving its inhibition of the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a. Accordingly, the inotropic effects of Hsp20 were abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable PLN (S16A/T17A). Interestingly, the activity of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), a known regulator of PLN signaling, was significantly reduced by Hsp20 overexpression, suggesting that the Hsp20 stimulatory effects are partially mediated through the PP1-PLN axis. This hypothesis was supported by cell fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization studies, which revealed an association between Hsp20, PP1, and PLN. Furthermore, recombinant protein studies confirmed a physical interaction between AA 73 to 160 in Hsp20 and AA 163 to 330 in PP1. CONCLUSIONS: Hsp20 is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling by targeting the PP1-PLN axis. These findings, coupled with the well-recognized cardioprotective role of Hsp20, suggest a dual benefit of targeting Hsp20 in heart disease.',\n",
              "  'Multimodal imaging with (18)F-FDG PET and Cerenkov luminescence imaging after MLN4924 treatment in a human lymphoma xenograft model. UNLABELLED: Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) is an emerging imaging technique that combines aspects of both optical and nuclear imaging fields. The ability to fully evaluate the correlation and sensitivity of CLI to PET is critical to progress this technique further for use in high-throughput screening of pharmaceutical compounds. To achieve this milestone, it must first be established that CLI data correlate to PET data in an in vivo preclinical antitumor study. We used MLN4924, a phase 2 oncology therapeutic, which targets and inhibits the NEDD8-activating enzyme pathway involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We compared the efficacious effects of MLN4924 using PET and Cerenkov luminescence image values in the same animals. METHODS: Imaging of (18)F-FDG uptake was performed at 5 time points after drug treatment in the subcutaneously implanted diffuse large B-cell lymphoma tumor line OCI-Ly10. Data were acquired with both modalities on the same day, with a 15-min delay between CLI and PET. PET data analysis was performed using percentage injected dose per cubic centimeter of tissue (%ID/cm(3)), average standardized uptake values, and total glycolytic volume. CLI measurements were radiance, radiance per injected dose (radiance/ID), and total radiant volume. RESULTS: A strong correlation was found between PET total glycolytic volume and CLI total radiant volume (r(2) = 0.99) and various PET and CLI analysis methods, with strong correlations found between PET %ID/cm(3) and CLI radiance (r(2) = 0.83) and CLI radiance/ID (r(2) = 0.82). MLN4924 demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor volume after treatment (volume ratio of treated vs. control, 0.114 at day 29). CONCLUSION: The PET and CLI data presented confirm the correlation and dynamic sensitivity of this new imaging modality. CLI provides a preclinical alternative to expensive PET instrumentation. Future high-throughput studies should provide for quicker turnaround and higher cost-to-return benefits in the drug discovery process.',\n",

              "  'Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in healthy male volunteers: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1 trial. BACKGROUND: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity in a 1:1 molar ratio. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of increasing doses of idarucizumab for the reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in a two-part phase 1 study (rising-dose assessment and dose-finding, proof-of-concept investigation). Here we present the results of the proof-of-concept part of the study. METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, proof-of-concept phase 1 study, we enrolled healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years) with a body-mass index of 18·5-29·9 kg/m(2) into one of four dose groups at SGS Life Sciences Clinical Research Services, Belgium. Participants were randomly assigned within groups in a 3:1 ratio to idarucizumab or placebo using a pseudorandom number generator and a supplied seed number. Participants and care providers were masked to treatment assignment. All participants received oral dabigatran etexilate 220 mg twice daily for 3 days and a final dose on day 4. Idarucizumab (1 g, 2 g, or 4 g 5-min infusion, or 5 g plus 2·5 g in two 5-min infusions given 1 h apart) was administered about 2 h after the final dabigatran etexilate dose. The primary endpoint was incidence of drug-related adverse events, analysed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of dabigatran etexilate. Reversal of diluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT) were secondary endpoints assessed by measuring the area under the effect curve from 2 h to 12 h (AUEC2-12) after dabigatran etexilate ingestion on days 3 and 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01688830. FINDINGS: Between Feb 23, and Nov 29, 2013, 47 men completed this part of the study. 12 were enrolled into each of the 1 g, 2 g, or 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab groups (nine to idarucizumab and three to placebo in each group), and 11 were enrolled into the 4 g idarucizumab group (eight to idarucizumab and three to placebo). Drug-related adverse events were all of mild intensity and reported in seven participants: one in the 1 g idarucizumab group (infusion site erythema and hot flushes), one in the 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab group (epistaxis); one receiving placebo (infusion site haematoma), and four during dabigatran etexilate pretreatment (three haematuria and one epistaxis). Idarucizumab immediately and completely reversed dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in a dose-dependent manner; the mean ratio of day 4 AUEC2-12 to day 3 AUEC2-12 for dTT was 1·01 with placebo, 0·26 with 1 g idarucizumab (74% reduction), 0·06 with 2 g idarucizumab (94% reduction), 0·02 with 4 g idarucizumab (98% reduction), and 0·01 with 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab (99% reduction). No serious or severe adverse events were reported, no adverse event led to discontinuation of treatment, and no clinically relevant difference in incidence of adverse events was noted between treatment groups. INTERPRETATION: These phase 1 results show that idarucizumab was associated with immediate, complete, and sustained reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in healthy men, and was well tolerated with no unexpected or clinically relevant safety concerns, supporting further testing. Further clinical studies are in progress. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG.',\n",
              "  \"McLeod syndrome resulting from a novel XK mutation. McLeod Syndrome (MLS) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by haemopoietic abnormalities and late-onset neurological and muscular defects. The McLeod blood group phenotype is typically associated with erythrocyte acanthocytosis, absence of the Kx antigen and reduced expression of Kell system antigens. MLS is caused by hemizygosity for mutations in the XK gene. We describe a patient with MLS who first showed symptoms in 1989 (aged 51 years). As the disease progressed, the patient developed a slight dementia, aggressive behaviour and choreatic movements. A cardiomyopathy was also diagnosed. An electroneuromyography showed neuropathic and myopathic changes. Liver enzymes were elevated and a blood smear showed acanthocytes. MLS was confirmed by serological analysis of the Kell antigens. Analysis of red blood cells by flow cytometry revealed the patient and his grandson to have reduced Kell antigen expression. The patient's daughters had two populations of red cells, consistent with them being heterozygous for an XK0 allele. The molecular basis of MLS in this family is a novel mutation consisting of a 7453-bp deletion that includes exon 2 of the XK gene. This confirms that the patient's 7-year-old grandson, who is currently asymptomatic, also has the XK0 allele and is therefore likely to develop MLS.\",\n",
              "  'Inhibition of CaM kinase II activation and force maintenance by KN-93 in arterial smooth muscle. Ca(+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) has been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contractility. The goals of this study were to determine: 1) to what extent CaM kinase II is activated by contractile stimuli in intact arterial smooth muscle, and 2) the effect of a CaM kinase II inhibitor (KN-93) on CaM kinase II activation, phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains (MLC(20)), and force. Both histamine (1 microM) and KCl depolarization activated CaM kinase II with a time course preceding maximal force development, and suprabasal CaM kinase II activation was sustained during tonic contractions. CaM kinase II activation was inhibited by KN-93 pretreatment (IC(50) approximately 1 microM). KN-93 inhibited histamine-induced tonic force maintenance, whereas early force development and MLC(20) phosphorylation responses during the entire time course were unaffected. Both force development and maintenance in response to KCl were inhibited by KN-93. Rapid increases in KCl-induced MLC(20) phosphorylation were also inhibited by KN-93, whereas steady-state MLC(20) phosphorylation responses were unaffected. In contrast, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) did not activate CaM kinase II and PDBu-stimulated force development was unaffected by KN-93. Thus KN-93 appears to target a step(s) essential for force maintenance in response to physiological stimuli, suggesting a role for CaM kinase II in regulating tonic contractile responses in arterial smooth muscle. Pharmacological activation of protein kinase C bypasses the KN-93 sensitive step.',\n",
              "  'SEA0400, a novel and selective inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, attenuates reperfusion injury in the in vitro and in vivo cerebral ischemic models. The effect of the newly synthesized compound 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) on the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) was investigated and compared against that of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). In addition, the effects of SEA0400 on reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo were examined. SEA0400 was extremely more potent than KB-R7943 in inhibiting Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in cultured neurons, astrocytes, and microglia: IC50s of SEA0400 and KB-R7943 were 5 to 33 nM and 2 to 4 microM, respectively. SEA0400 at the concentration range that inhibited NCX exhibited negligible affinities for the Ca2+ channels, Na+ channels, K+ channels, norepinephrine transporter, and 14 receptors, and did not affect the activities of the Na+/H+ exchanger, Na+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and five enzymes. SEA0400, unlike KB-R7943, did not inhibit the store-operated Ca2+ entry in cultured astrocytes. SEA0400 attenuated dose- dependently paradoxical Ca2+ challenge-induced production of reactive oxygen species, DNA ladder formation, and nuclear condensation in cultured astrocytes, whereas it did not affect thapsigargin-induced cell injury. Furthermore, administration of SEA0400 reduced infarct volumes after a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rat cerebral cortex and striatum. These results indicate that SEA0400 is the most potent and selective inhibitor of NCX, and suggest that the compound may exert protective effects on postischemic brain damage.',\n",
              "  'Antinociceptive mechanism of L-DOPA. The mechanism of L-DOPA for antinociception was investigated. Nociceptive behaviors in mice after an intrathecal (i.t.) administration of substance P were evaluated. L-DOPA (i.t.) dose-dependently attenuated the substance P-induced nociceptive behaviors. Co-administration of benserazide (i.t.), a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, abolished the antinociceptive effect of L-DOPA. The L-DOPA-induced antinociception was antagonized by sulpiride, a D2 blocker, but not by SCH 23390, a D1 blocker. These results suggest that L-DOPA relieves pain after conversion to dopamine, with the dopamine sedating pain transmission by way of the dopamine D2 receptor.',\n",
              "  'SCF(HOS) ubiquitin ligase mediates the ligand-induced down-regulation of the interferon-alpha receptor. Down-regulation of activated signaling receptors in response to their ligands plays a key role in restricting the extent and duration of the signaling. Mechanisms underlying down-regulation of the type I interferon receptor consisting of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits remain largely unknown. Here we show that IFNAR1 interacts with the Homolog of Slimb (HOS) F-box protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and that this interaction is promoted by interferon alpha (IFNalpha). IFNAR1 is ubiquitinated by the Skp1-Cullin1-HOS-Roc1 (SCF(HOS)) ubiquitin ligase in vitro. HOS expression and activities are required for IFNalpha-stimulated ubiquitination of IFNAR1, endocytosis of the type I interferon receptor, down-regulation of IFNAR1 levels, and IFNAR1 proteolysis via the lysosomal pathway. Furthermore, modulations of HOS activities affect the extent of Stat1 phosphorylation and Stat-mediated transcriptional activities as well as the extent of antiproliferative effects of type I interferons. These findings characterize SCF(HOS) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is essential for ubiquitination, proteolysis and down-regulation of IFNAR1, and implicate HOS in the regulation of cellular responses to IFNalpha.',\n",
              "  'The heme-Bach1 pathway in the regulation of oxidative stress response and erythroid differentiation. Heme--as a prosthetic group of proteins required for oxygen transport and storage, respiration, and biosynthetic pathways--is essential for practically all forms of life. Additionally, the degradation products of heme (i.e., carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and bilirubin) produced by the enzymatic actions of heme oxygenase (HO) and biliverdin reductase, possess various biological activities in vivo. In mammalian cells, heme also functions as an intracellular regulator of gene expression by virtue of its ability to bind to Bach1, a transcription factor that functions in association with small Maf proteins. Normally, such complexes function as repressors by binding to specific target sequences, the Maf recognition element (MARE), within enhancers of genes encoding proteins such as HO-1 and beta-globin. By binding to Bach1, heme induces selective removal of the repressor from the gene enhancers permitting subsequent occupancy of the MAREs by activators that, interestingly, also contain small Maf proteins. Thus small Maf proteins play dual functions in gene expression: complexes with Bach1 repress MARE-dependent gene expression, whereas heterodimers with NF-E2 p45 or related factors (Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3) activate MARE-driven genes. By modulating the equilibrium of the small Maf heterodimer network, heme regulates expression of the cytoprotective enzyme HO-1 during the stress response and of beta-globin during erythroid differentiation. Implications of such heme-regulated gene expression in human diseases including atherosclerosis are discussed.',\n",
              "  'Down-regulation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphatase M3/6 and activation of JNK by hydrogen peroxide and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. Oxidative stress activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. However, the exact mechanisms by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate JNK are unclear. We found that the ability of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to induce JNK activation varied in different cell types. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a presumed antioxidant, induced JNK activation on its own and enhanced JNK activation by H(2)O(2) in many cell types, including Jurkat, HEK293, and LNCaP and Tsu-Pr1 prostate cancer cells. The activation of JNK by PDTC, in the presence or absence of exogenous H(2)O(2), was dependent on its chelating ability to metal ions, most likely copper ions. Despite the strong JNK-activating ability, H(2)O(2) plus PDTC did not induce significant activation of the upstream kinases, SEK1/MKK4 and MKK7. However, the JNK inactivation rate was slower in cells treated with H(2)O(2) plus PDTC compared with the rate in cells treated with ultraviolet C (UV-C). Treatment of H(2)O(2) plus PDTC significantly decreased the expression levels of a JNK phosphatase, M3/6 (also named hVH-5), but not the levels of other phosphatases (PP2A and PP4). In contrast, UV-C irradiation did not cause the down-regulation of M3/6. These results suggest that JNK activation by H(2)O(2) plus PDTC resulted from the down-regulation of JNK phosphatases. Our data also reveal a necessity to carefully evaluate the pharmacological and biochemical properties of PDTC.',\n",
              "  \"Prevention of JNK phosphorylation as a mechanism for rosiglitazone in neuroprotection after transient cerebral ischemia: activation of dual specificity phosphatase. Rosiglitazone, a synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonist, prevents cell death after cerebral ischemia in animal models, but the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. In this study, we examined how rosiglitazone protects neurons against ischemia. Mice treated with rosiglitazone were subjected to 60 minutes of focal ischemia followed by reperfusion. Rosiglitazone reduced infarct volume after ischemia and reperfusion. We show that this neuroprotective effect was reversed with a PPARγ antagonist. Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in expression of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38) in ischemic brain tissue. Rosiglitazone blocked this increase. Furthermore, we observed that rosiglitazone increased expression of the dual-specificity phosphatase 8 (DUSP8) protein and messenger RNA in ischemic brain tissue. Dual-specificity phosphatase 8 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase that can dephosphorylate JNK and p38. Another key finding of the present study was that knockdown of DUSP8 in primary cultured cortical neurons that were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation diminished rosiglitazone's effect on downregulation of JNK phosphorylation. Thus, rosiglitazone's neuroprotective effect after ischemia is mediated by blocking JNK phosphorylation induced by ischemia via DUSP8 upregulation.\",\n",
              "  'Expression of DeltaNp73 is a molecular marker for adverse outcome in neuroblastoma patients. The p73 gene is a p53 homologue which induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation. Although p73 maps at 1p36.3 and is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma (NB), it does not act as a classic oncosuppressor gene. In developing sympathetic neurons of mice, p73 is predominantly expressed as a truncated anti-apoptotic isoform (DeltaNp73), which antagonizes both p53 and the full-length p73 protein (TAp73). This suggests that p73 may be part of a complex tumor-control mechanism. To determine the role of DeltaNp73 in NB we analyzed the pattern of expression of this gene in vivo and evaluated the prognostic significance of its expression. Our results indicate that DeltaNp73 expression is associated with reduced apoptosis in a NB tumor tissue. Expression of this variant in NB patients significantly correlates with age at diagnosis and VMA urinary excretion. Moreover it is strongly associated with reduced survival (HR=7.93; P<0.001) and progression-free survival (HR=5.3; P<0.001) and its role in predicting a poorer outcome is independent from age, primary tumor site, stage and MYCN amplification (OS: HR=5.24, P=0.012; PFS: HR=4.36, P=0.005). In conclusion our data seem to indicate that DeltaNp73 is a crucial gene in neuroblastoma pathogenesis.',\n",
              "  'Impact of DNA repair pathways on the cytotoxicity of piperlongumine in chicken DT40 cell-lines. Piperlongumine is a naturally-occurring small molecule with various biological activities. Recent studies demonstrate that piperlongumine selectively kills various types of transformed cells with minimal toxicity to non-transformed cells by inducing a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS generates various types of DNA lesions, including base modifications and single strand breaks. In order to examine the contribution of ROS-induced DNA damage to the cytotoxicity by piperlongumine, various DNA repair-deficient chicken DT40 cell-lines with a single DNA repair gene deletion were tested for cellular sensitivity to piperlongumine. The results showed that cell lines defective in homologous recombination (HR) display hyper-sensitivity to piperlongumine, while other cell lines with a deficiency in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, or translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases, show no sensitivity to piperlongumine. The results strongly implicate that double strand breaks (DSBs) generated by piperlongumine are major cytotoxic DNA lesions. Furthermore, a deletion of 53BP1 or Ku70 in the BRCA1-deficient cell line restored cellular resistance to piperlongumine. This strongly supports the idea that piperlongumine induces DSB- mediated cell death. Interestingly, piperlongumine makes the wild type DT40 cell line hypersensitive to a PARP-inhibitor, Olaparib. The results implicate that piperlongumine inhibits HR. Further analysis with cell-based HR assay and the kinetic study of Rad51 foci formation confirmed that piperlongumine suppresses HR activity. Altogether, we revealed novel mechanisms of piperlongumine-induced cytotoxicity.',\n",
              "  \"Friedreich's ataxia associated with mitochondrial myopathy: clinicopathologic report. A 13-year-old boy with clinical and electrophysiologic findings of Friedreich's ataxia developed unusually prominent myopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed mitochondrial proliferation and structural abnormalities. No mutation was found in skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA to explain this finding. Molecular genetic and pathologic studies confirmed a diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia in the proband and affected relatives. Although the Friedreich's ataxia phenotype results from decreased expression of a mitochondrially targeted protein, frataxin, mitochondrial myopathy has not been described as a feature of the disease. The association between the frataxin gene mutation and mitochondrial myopathy in this case suggests that severe or cumulative insults to mitochondrial function may produce myopathic changes in some cases of Friedreich's ataxia. The patient also responded clinically to carnitine supplementation, suggesting a potential palliative therapy for the disease.\",\n",
              "  'The dopamine transporter is decreased in the striatum of subjects with restless legs syndrome. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Prior studies, all using SPECT techniques, failed to find any differences for dopamine transporter (DAT) in restless legs syndrome (RLS) subjects. The distinct pharmacokinetic properties associated with SPECT-determined DAT along with rapid biodynamic changes in DAT may, however, have missed membrane-bound DAT differences. The current studies assessed real-time DAT binding potentials (BP) in striatum of RLS patients using (11)C-methylphenidate and PET techniques. DESIGN: RLS medications were stopped at least 11 days prior to the PET study. Clinical severity of RLS was also assessed. PET scans were performed at 2 different times of day (starting at 08:30 and 19:30) in separate groups of subjects. The primary outcome measure was total striatal DAT BP. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six patients with primary RLS and 34 age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: RLS subjects had significantly lower DAT binding in the striatum compared to controls on both the Day and the Night scans. DAT was decreased in putamen and caudate but not the ventral striatum of RLS subjects. There were no diurnal differences in DAT for the total group or for control and RLS separately. DAT BP did not correlate with any clinical measures of RLS. CONCLUSION: The current study found a significant decrease in DAT BP in two independent studies. These results when viewed along with prior RLS SPECT and autopsy studies of DAT, and cell culture studies with iron deficiency and DAT, suggest that membrane-bound striatal DAT, but not total cellular DAT, may be decreased in RLS.',\n",
              "  'Stabilization of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor ion channel-FKBP12 complex by the 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative S107. Activation of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) complex results in the rapid release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and muscle contraction. Dissociation of the small FK506 binding protein 12 subunit (FKBP12) increases RyR1 activity and impairs muscle function. The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, and the more specific derivative S107 (2,3,4,5,-tetrahydro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-1,4-benzothiazepine), are thought to improve skeletal muscle function by stabilizing the RyR1-FKBP12 complex. Here, we report a high degree of nonspecific and specific low affinity [(3)H]S107 binding to SR vesicles. SR vesicles enriched in RyR1 bound ∼48 [(3)H]S107 per RyR1 tetramer with EC(50) ∼52 µM and Hillslope ∼2. The effects of S107 and FKBP12 on RyR1 were examined under conditions that altered the redox state of RyR1. S107 increased FKBP12 binding to RyR1 in SR vesicles in the presence of reduced glutathione and the NO-donor NOC12, with no effect in the presence of oxidized glutathione. Addition of 0.15 µM FKBP12 to SR vesicles prevented FKBP12 dissociation; however, in the presence of oxidized glutathione and NOC12, FKBP12 dissociation was observed in skeletal muscle homogenates that contained 0.43 µM myoplasmic FKBP12 and was attenuated by S107. In single channel measurements with FKBP12-depleted RyR1s, in the absence and presence of NOC12, S107 augmented the FKBP12-mediated decrease in channel activity. The data suggest that S107 can reverse the harmful effects of redox active species on SR Ca(2+) release in skeletal muscle by binding to RyR1 low affinity sites.',\n",
              "  \"Immunotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the era of BTK inhibitors. Understanding the pathogenesis of CLL has uncovered a plethora of novel targets for human application of monoclonal antibodies, engineered T cells, or inhibitors of signal transduction pathways. The B-cell receptor signaling pathway is being actively explored as a therapeutic target in CLL. Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is showing impressive responses in heavily pre-treated high-risk CLL, whether alone or in combination with MoAbs or chemotherapy. Other key components of the BCR pathway, namely PI3K-δ, are also being targeted with novel therapies with promising results as well. Future trials would likely evaluate ibrutinib in the front-line setting. Moreover, improvements in allogeneic HCT mostly by continuing to reduce associated toxicity as well as incorporating cellular therapies such as autologous CLL tumor vaccines, among others, will continue to expand. This is also the case for the next generation of chimeric antigen receptor therapy for CLL once genetically modified T cells are available at broad scale and with improved efficacy. As our ability to further refine and integrate these therapies continues to improve, and we gain further knowledge from gene sequencing, we anticipate that treatment algorithms will continue to be revised to a more personalized approach to treat this disease with improved efficacy and devoid of unnecessary toxicity.\",\n",

PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, nonsteroidal, reversible, selective 17,20-lyase inhibitor. This study examined orteronel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed after docetaxel therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study, 1,099 men were randomly assigned in a 2:1 schedule to receive orteronel 400 mg plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily or placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily, stratified by region (Europe, North America [NA], and non-Europe/NA) and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form worst pain score. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Key secondary end points (radiographic progression-free survival [rPFS], > 50% decrease of prostate-specific antigen [PSA50], and pain response at 12 weeks) were to undergo statistical testing only if the primary end point analysis was significant. RESULTS: The study was unblinded after crossing a prespecified OS futility boundary. The median OS was 17.0 months versus 15.2 months with orteronel-prednisone versus placebo-prednisone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.886; 95% CI, 0.739 to 1.062; P = .190). Improved rPFS was observed with orteronel-prednisone (median, 8.3 v 5.7 months; HR, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.653 to 0.885; P < .001). Orteronel-prednisone showed advantages over placebo-prednisone in PSA50 rate (25% v 10%, P < .001) and time to PSA progression (median, 5.5 v 2.9 months, P < .001) but not pain response rate (12% v 9%; P = .128). Adverse events (all grades) were generally more frequent with orteronel-prednisone, including nausea (42% v 26%), vomiting (36% v 17%), fatigue (29% v 23%), and increased amylase (14% v 2%). CONCLUSION: Our study did not meet the primary end point of OS. Longer rPFS and a higher PSA50 rate with orteronel-prednisone indicate antitumor activity.',\n",
              "  \"Indication for antihypertensive treatment: superiority of ambulatory vs casual blood pressure measurement. The antihypertensive effect of isradipine was studied in 45 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension (mean age 59 years) using casual and ambulatory 24-h blood pressure measurement. Patients were included into the study according to their casual blood pressure. Isradipine was started at a dose of 1.25 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, and increased to 2.5 mg twice daily if casual blood pressure was not normalized. If necessary, 3 mg of spirapril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, (n = 1) or 5 mg of pindolol (n = 1) was added. The active-treatment period lasted 24 weeks. At the end of the therapy, casual blood pressure was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) from 173/103 to 150/86 mmHg, and mean ambulatory blood pressure, from 146/87 to 140/83 mmHg (p < 0.05). When patients were divided into three groups according to initial whole-day ambulatory blood pressure values (group I: < 140/90 mmHg; group II: > or = 140/90 mmHg; group III: > or = 140/<90 mmHg), no effect of treatment was detected in group I. However, whole-day blood pressure fell significantly (p < 0.001) in group II (155/96 vs 143/88 mmHg) as did systolic blood pressure (p < 0.01) in group III (150/83 vs 142/81 mmHg), whereas diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. Thus, ambulatory blood pressure measurement may be superior to casual measurement in the decision-making process to treat hypertension, avoiding not only the phenomenon of 'white-coat hypertension', but also ineffective treatment. This conclusion, however, should be confirmed by prospective studies.\",\n",

The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The birth prevalence is approximately one in 10,000 live births, accounting for 8-10% of patients with coronal synostosis. Although MS is a relatively common diagnosis in patients with craniosynostosis syndromes, with autosomal dominant inheritance, there has been no report of MS, in an affected Korean family with typical cephalo-facial morphology that has been confirmed by molecular studies. Here, we report a familial case of MS in a female patient with a Pro250Arg mutation in exon 7 (IgII-IGIII linker domain) of the FGFR3 gene. This patient had mild midfacial hypoplasia, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, a beak shaped nose, plagio-brachycephaly, and mild neurodevelopmental delay.

Phthiriasis palpebrarum is an infestation of the eyelashes caused by the louse Pthirus pubis (Linnaeus, 1758). We report a case of phthiriasis palpebrarum in a 6-year-old girl, which was initially misdiagnosed as allergic blepharoconjunctivitis. Parasites and their nits were found adhering to the eyelashes and eyelids of her right eye as well as scalp hairs. No abnormality was found in the left eye. The histopathology exam revealed the presence of adults and eggs of Pthirus pubis. We mechanically removed all the eyelashes of the right eye at their base, with lice and nits. The scalp was shaved and washed with phenothrin shampoo. No recurrence was found during 3 months of follow-up. Removal of the eyelashes, cutting of scalp hairs, and phenothrin shampoo may be effective in treating phthiriasis palpebrarum. In cases of blepharoconjunctivitis, eyelids and eyelashes should be carefully examined by slit lamp to avoid misdiagnosis.',\n",

We have developed a technology called light-activated dimerization (LAD) to artificially induce protein hetero- and homodimerization in live cells using light. Using the FKF1 and GIGANTEA (GI) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana, we have generated protein tags whose interaction is controlled by blue light. We demonstrated the utility of this system with LAD constructs that can recruit the small G-protein Rac1 to the plasma membrane and induce the local formation of lamellipodia in response to focal illumination. We also generated a light-activated transcription factor by fusing domains of GI and FKF1 to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of VP16, respectively, showing that this technology is easily adapted to other systems. These studies set the stage for the development of light-regulated signaling molecules for controlling receptor activation, synapse formation and other signaling events in organisms.',\n",
              "  'A transient kinetic analysis of PRMT1 catalysis. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important strategies used by eukaryotic organisms to modulate their phenotypes. One of the well-studied PTMs, arginine methylation, is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) with SAM as the methyl donor. The functions of PRMTs have been broadly studied in different biological processes and diseased states, but the molecular basis for arginine methylation is not well-defined. In this study, we report the transient-state kinetic analysis of PRMT1 catalysis. The fast association and dissociation rates suggest that PRMT1 catalysis of histone H4 methylation follows a rapid equilibrium sequential kinetic mechanism. The data give direct evidence that the chemistry of methyl transfer is the major rate-limiting step and that binding of the cofactor SAM or SAH affects the association and dissociation of H4 with PRMT1. Importantly, from the stopped-flow fluorescence measurements, we have identified a critical kinetic step suggesting a precatalytic conformational transition induced by substrate binding. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of arginine methylation and the rational design of PRMT inhibitors.',\n",
              "  'Protective effect of JTV519, a new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, on prolonged myocardial preservation. BACKGROUND: JTV519 is know to protect cardiomyocytes from calcium overloading-induced damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective effect of JTV519 on myocardium subjected to prolonged ischemia and the underlying mechanism of such protection. The effect of JTV519 was also compared with that of diltiazem, a 1,5-benzothiazepine derivative. METHODS: Isolated rat hearts were randomly divided into three groups. Control hearts were arrested with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarat (HTK) cardioplegic solution alone. In the JTV519 group of hearts, cardiac arrest was achieved with JTV519 (10(-3) mmol/L) in the HTK solution. Hearts in the diltiazem group were arrested with diltiazem (0.5 mmol/L) in the HTK solution. All the hearts were then subjected to 6-hour storage in HTK solution at 4 degrees C. RESULTS: After a 30-minute reperfusion, the left ventricular developed pressure in the JTV519 and diltiazem groups were improved significantly compared with the control group. There was a significantly lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure level and higher recovery of coronary flow in the JTV519 group than in the control group. The postischemic intracellular calcium concentration was attenuated by adding JTV519 or diltiazem to HTK cardioplegia. CONCLUSION: As an adjunct to cardioplegia, JTV519 showed a significant protective effect on myocardium undergoing 6 hours of ischemia. The beneficial protective effects of JTV519 are correlated with its ability to inhibit the postischemic rise in intracellular calcium.',\n",

              "  'Molecular and cellular bases of chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the overproduction of granulocytes, which leads to high white blood cell counts and splenomegaly in patients. Based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, CML is classified into three clinical phases, often starting with a chronic phase, progressing to an accelerated phase and ultimately ending in a terminal phase called blast crisis. Blast crisis phase of CML is clinically similar to an acute leukemia; in particular, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a severe form of acute leukemia in blast crisis, and there is no effective therapy for it yet. CML is induced by the BCR-ABL oncogene, whose gene product is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Currently, inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by its kinase inhibitor such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a major therapeutic strategy for CML. However, the inability of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors to completely kill leukemia stem cells (LSCs) indicates that these kinase inhibitors are unlikely to cure CML. In addition, drug resistance due to the development of BCRABL mutations occurs before and during treatment of CML with kinase inhibitors. A critical issue to resolve this problem is to fully understand the biology of LSCs, and to identify key genes that play significant roles in survival and self-renewal of LSCs. In this review, we will focus on LSCs in CML by summarizing and discussing available experimental results, including the original studies from our own laboratory.',\n",

In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended. However, the frequency of biochemical thyroid assessment, particularly in the first year of life, is being debated. In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation. Therefore, treatment with L-thyroxinewas started. Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life.',\n",

Double homeobox 4 (DUX4) is a candidate disease gene for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), one of the most common muscular dystrophies characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. Despite great strides in understanding precise genetics of FSHD, the molecular pathophysiology of the disease remains unclear. One of the major limitations has been the availability of appropriate molecular tools to study DUX4 protein. In the present study, we report the development of five new monoclonal antibodies targeted against the N- and C-termini of human DUX4, and characterize their reactivity using Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Additionally, we show that expression of the canonical full coding DUX4 induces cell death in human primary muscle cells, whereas the expression of a shorter splice form of DUX4 results in no such toxicity. Immunostaining with these new antibodies reveals a differential effect of two DUX4 isoforms on human muscle cells. These antibodies will provide an excellent tool for investigating the role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis.',\n",

Immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-RSD) represents a recently identified inflammatory disorder in which infiltration of IgG4 plasma cells causes fibrosis in organs. While IgG4-RSD is well documented in the pancreas and other organs, it is poorly characterized in the thyroid gland. We report a case of a 48-year-old female with a fibrotic thyroid mass associated with a retroperitoneal fibrosis.

              "  'Safety and tolerability of ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor, in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma: an open-label phase 1/2 study. BACKGROUND: The combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone is a highly effective therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Ixazomib is an investigational, oral, proteasome inhibitor with promising anti-myeloma effects and low rates of peripheral neuropathy. In a phase 1/2 trial we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and activity of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. METHODS: We enrolled patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma aged 18 years or older with measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and no grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, and treated them with oral ixazomib (days 1, 8, 15) plus lenalidomide 25 mg (days 1-21) and dexamethasone 40 mg (days 1, 8, 15, 22) for up to 12 28-day cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with ixazomib alone. In phase 1, we gave patients escalating doses of ixazomib (1·68-3·95 mg/m(2)) to establish the recommended dose for phase 2. The primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose for phase 1, and the rate of very good partial response or better for phase 2. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug; efficacy analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug at the phase 2 dose, had measurable disease at baseline, and had at least one post-baseline response assessment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01217957. FINDINGS: Between Nov 22, 2010, and Feb 28, 2012, we enrolled 65 patients (15 to phase 1 and 50 to phase 2). Four dose-limiting toxic events were noted in phase 1: one at a dose of ixazomib of 2·97 mg/m(2) and three at 3·95 mg/m(2). The maximum tolerated dose of ixazomib was established as 2·97 mg/m(2) and the recommended phase 2 dose was 2·23 mg/m(2), which was converted to a 4·0 mg fixed dose based on population pharmacokinetic results. Grade 3 or higher adverse events related to any drug were reported in 41 (63%) patients, including skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (11 patients, 17%), neutropenia (eight patients, 12%), and thrombocytopenia (five patients, 8%); drug-related peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or higher occurred in four (6%) patients. Five patients discontinued because of adverse events. In 64 response-evaluable patients, 37 (58%, 95% CI 45-70) had a very good partial response or better. INTERPRETATION: The all-oral combination of weekly ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone was generally well tolerated and appeared active in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. These results support the phase 3 trial development of this combination for multiple myeloma.

              "  'Complete OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiency causes human Rotor syndrome by interrupting conjugated bilirubin reuptake into the liver. Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.',\n",
              "  'Multiple origins of replication in archaea. Until recently, the only archaeon for which a bona fide origin of replication was reported was Pyrococcus abyssi, where a single origin was identified. Although several in silico analyses have suggested that some archaeal species might contain more than one origin, this has only been demonstrated recently. Two studies have shown that multiple origins of replication function in two archaeal species. One study identified two origins of replication in the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, whereas a second study used a different technique to show that both S. solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius have three functional origins. These are the first reports of archaea having multiple origins. This finding has implications for research on the mechanisms of DNA replication and evolution.',\n",
              "  'Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome: a Norwegian perspective. Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (MIM 220400; JLNS), is a rare form of profound congenital deafness combined with syncopal attacks and sudden death due to prolonged QTc; it is an autosomal recessive trait. After its first description in Norway in 1957, later reports from many other countries have confirmed its occurrence. Nowhere is the prevalence so high as in Norway, where we estimate a prevalence of at least 1:200,000. The KCNQ1 and KCNE1 proteins coassemble in a potassium channel, and mutations in either the KCNQ1 gene or the KCNE1 gene disrupt endolymph production in the stria vascularis in the cochlea, causing deafness. KCNQ1 seems to be the major gene in JLNS. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a separate disorder of either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance caused by mutations in four different ion channel genes; KCNQ1 is the one most frequently involved. Some heterozygous carriers of JLNS mutations in either gene may suffer from prolonged QTc and be symptomatic LQTS patients with a need for appropriate medical treatment to prevent life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. In general, frameshift/stop mutations cause JLNS, and missense/splice site mutations cause LQTS, but a precise genotype-phenotype correlation in LQTS and JLNS is not established, which complicates both genetic counseling and clinical risk evaluation in carriers. We review JLNS from a Norwegian perspective because of the unusually high prevalence, the genetic homogeneity associated with considerable mutational heterogeneity, and some evidence for recurrent mutational events as well as one founder mutation. We outline the clinical implications for investigation of deaf children and cases of sudden infant death syndrome as well as careful electrocardiographic monitoring of identified mutation carriers to prevent sudden death.

              "  'BRCA1-associated epigenetic regulation of p73 mediates an effector pathway for chemosensitivity in ovarian carcinoma. The majority of tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers exhibit inactivation of p53, a key effector of cell death after DNA damage. Despite the loss of p53, BRCA1-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cisplatin, and patients with BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinomas experience improved outcomes with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with sporadic cases. Although it is known that chemosensitivity in BRCA1-associated cancers is associated with unrepaired DNA damage, the specific effector pathway mediating the cellular response to platinum-induced damage in these tumors is poorly understood. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73, encoding a proapoptotic protein that is linked to chemosensitivity in many settings, is upregulated through a novel epigenetic mechanism in both human and murine models of BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinoma. BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor ZEB1, leading to the abrogation of ZEB1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms (TAp73). Cisplatin chemotherapy induces TAp73 target genes specifically in BRCA1-deficient cells, and knockdown of TAp73 in these cells causes chemoresistance while having little or no effect on BRCA1-expressing tumor cells. In primary ovarian carcinomas, ZEB1 binding site methylation and TAp73 expression correlate with BRCA1 status and with clinical response. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism that supports the contribution of TAp73 as an important mediator of the response to platinum chemotherapy in a subset of ovarian carcinomas. TAp73 might represent a response predictor and potential therapeutic target for enhancing chemosensitivity in this disease.',\n",
              "  'Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review of the evidence. OBJECTIVE: To review available studies of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved in 2014 by the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DATA SOURCES: PubMed was searched using the search terms empagliflozin, BI 10773, and BI10773, for entries between January 1, 2000, and December 1, 2014. Reference lists from retrieved articles were searched manually for additional peer-reviewed publications. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All publications reporting clinical trials of empagliflozin were eligible for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Empagliflozin is a new once-daily oral SGLT2 inhibitor with a mechanism of action that is independent of β-cell function and the insulin pathway. Data from a comprehensive phase III clinical trial program have demonstrated its efficacy as monotherapy, as add-on to other glucose-lowering agents, and in different patient populations. In these studies, empagliflozin resulted in improvements in blood glucose levels as well as reductions in body weight and blood pressure. Empagliflozin was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia versus placebo. CONCLUSION: The oral antidiabetes agent, empagliflozin, can be used as monotherapy or alongside other glucose-lowering treatments, including insulin, to treat T2DM.',\n",

Activation of caspases occurs by a conserved mechanism subject to strict cellular regulation. Once activated by a specific stimulus, caspases execute limited proteolysis of downstream substrates to trigger a cascade of events that culminates in the desired biological response. Much has been learned of the mechanisms that govern the activation and regulation of caspases, and this minireview provides an update of these areas. We also delineate substantial gaps in knowledge of caspase function, which can be approached by techniques and experimental paradigms that are currently undergoing development.',\n",
              "  'Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces the apoptosis and inhibits osteoblast differentiation through JNK pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells. Bone degradation is a serious complication of chronic inflammatory diseases such as septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and infected orthopedic implant failure. Up to date, effective therapeutic treatments for bacteria-caused bone destruction are limited. In our previous study, we found that LPS promoted osteoclast differentiation and activity through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway such as c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2). The current study was to evaluate the mechanism of LPS on the apoptosis and osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells. MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were non-treated, treated with LPS. After treatment, the cell viability, the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and caspase-3 were measured. The expressions of osteoblast-specific genes and Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Protein levels of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and phosphorylation of MAPKs were measured using Western blotting assays. The MAPK signaling pathway was blocked by pretreatment with JNK inhibitor SP600125. LPS treatment induced a significant decrease in cell metabolism, viability, and ALP activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. LPS also significantly decreased mRNA expressions of osteoblast-related genes in MC3T3-E1 cells. On the other hand, LPS significantly upregulated mRNA expressions and protein levels of Bax and caspase-3 as well as activation of caspase-3, whereas decreased Bcl-2 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, LPS significantly promoted MAPK pathway including the phosphorylation of JNK and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2; moreover, pretreatment with JNK inhibitor not only attenuated both of phosphorylation-JNK and ERK1/2 enhanced by LPS in MC3T3-E1 cells, but also reversed the downregulated expressions of osteoblast-specific genes including ALP and BSP induced by LPS. In conclusion, LPS could induce osteoblast apoptosis and inhibit osteoblast differentiation via activation of JNK pathway.',\n",
              "  'Developmental and cell type-specific expression of thyroid hormone transporters in the mouse brain and in primary brain cells. Cellular thyroid hormone uptake and efflux are mediated by transmembrane transport proteins. One of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is mutated in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, a severe mental retardation associated with abnormal thyroid hormone constellations. Since mice deficient in Mct8 exhibit a milder neurological phenotype than patients, we hypothesized that alternative thyroid hormone transporters may compensate in murine brain cells for the lack of Mct8. Using qPCR, Western Blot, and immunocytochemistry, we investigated the expression of three different thyroid hormone transporters, i.e., Mct8 and L-type amino acid transporters Lat1 and Lat2, in mouse brain. All three thyroid hormone transporters are expressed from corticogenesis and peak around birth. Primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes express Mct8, Lat1, and Lat2. Microglia specifically expresses Mct10 and Slco4a1 in addition to high levels of Lat2 mRNA and protein. As in vivo, a brain microvascular endothelial cell line expressed Mct8 and Lat1. 158N, an oligodendroglial cell line expressed Mct8 protein, consistent with delayed myelination in MCT8-deficient patients. Functional T(3)- and T(4)-transport assays into primary astrocytes showed K(M) values of 4.2 and 3.7 μM for T(3) and T(4). Pharmacological inhibition of L-type amino acid transporters by BCH and genetic inactivation of Lat2 reduced astrocytic T(3) uptake to the same extent. BSP, a broad spectrum inhibitor, including Mct8, reduced T(3) uptake further suggesting the cooperative activity of several T(3) transporters in astrocytes.',\n",
              "  'Designing calcium release channel inhibitors with enhanced electron donor properties: stabilizing the closed state of ryanodine receptor type 1. New drugs with enhanced electron donor properties that target the ryanodine receptor from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (RyR1) are shown to be potent inhibitors of single-channel activity. In this article, we synthesize derivatives of the channel activator 4-chloro-3-methyl phenol (4-CmC) and the 1,4-benzothiazepine channel inhibitor 4-[-3{1-(4-benzyl) piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine (K201, JTV519) with enhanced electron donor properties. Instead of activating channel activity (~100 μM), the 4-methoxy analog of 4-CmC [4-methoxy-3-methyl phenol (4-MmC)] inhibits channel activity at submicromolar concentrations (IC(50) = 0.34 ± 0.08 μM). Increasing the electron donor characteristics of K201 by synthesizing its dioxole congener results in an approximately 16 times more potent RyR1 inhibitor (IC(50) = 0.24 ± 0.05 μM) compared with K201 (IC(50) = 3.98 ± 0.79 μM). Inhibition is not caused by an increased closed time of the channel but seems to be caused by an open state block of RyR1. These alterations to chemical structure do not influence the ability of these drugs to affect Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase type 1. Moreover, the FKBP12 protein, which stabilizes RyR1 in a closed configuration, is shown to be a strong electron donor. It seems as if FKBP12, K201, its dioxole derivative, and 4-MmC inhibit RyR1 channel activity by virtue of their electron donor characteristics. These results embody strong evidence that designing new drugs to target RyR1 with enhanced electron donor characteristics results in more potent channel inhibitors. This is a novel approach to the design of new, more potent drugs with the aim of functionally modifying RyR1 single-channel activity.',\n",
              "  \"Specificity of Dnmt1 for methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites resides in its catalytic domain. The maintenance methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites by the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is the molecular basis of the inheritance of DNA methylation patterns. Based on structural data and kinetics obtained with a truncated form of Dnmt1, an autoinhibition model for the specificity of Dnmt1 was proposed in which unmethylated DNA binds to Dnmt1's CXXC domain, which prevents its methylation. We have prepared CXXC domain variants that lost DNA binding. Corresponding full-length Dnmt1 variants did not display a reduction in specificity, indicating that the autoinhibition model does not apply in full-length Dnmt1. Furthermore, we show that the Dnmt1 M1235S variant, which carries an exchange in the catalytic domain of the enzyme, has a marked reduction in specificity, indicating that the recognition of the hemimethylated state of target sites resides within the catalytic domain.\",\n",
              "  'Reversal of cisplatin resistance by the 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV-519. The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV-519 is a new type of calcium ion channel modulator. We examined the modulatory effect of JTV-519 on the antitumor activity of several platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin, and nedaplatin) in a human cancer cell line resistant to cisplatin (PC-14 / CDDP) in vitro. PC-14 / CDDP cells showed 8-fold resistance to cisplatin compared with the parental PC-14 cells as determined by dye formation [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTT] assay. In PC-14 / CDDP, but not PC-14 cells, augmentation of cytotoxicity was observed when a nontoxic concentration (10 mM) of JTV-519 was combined with the platinum compounds. Increased intracellular cisplatin accumulation was observed in PC-14 / CDDP cells in the presence of JTV-519 as measured by atomic absorption assay. Therefore, increased cisplatin accumulation was considered to be a possible mechanism underlying the reversing effect of JTV-519 on cisplatin resistance. These results suggest that JTV-519 is a potent agent reversing cisplatin resistance.',\n",
              "  'beta-Carotene and cigarette smoke condensate regulate heme oxygenase-1 and its repressor factor Bach1: relationship with cell growth. It has been reported that beta-carotene is able to increase lung cancer risk in chronic smokers, but the mechanism for this association remains unknown. This article reports the first evidence that beta-carotene, combined with cigarette smoke condensate (TAR), regulates heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) via its transcriptional factor Bach1 and modulates cell growth. Both immortalized rat fibroblasts (RAT-1) and human lung cancer cells (Mv1Lu) exposed to TAR (25 microg/ml), exhibited an initial (6 h) induction of HO-1, followed by a late (24 h) repression due to the activation of Bach1. Heme oxygenase-1 repression was much more consistent when TAR was administered in combination with beta-carotene (1 microM) for 24 h; at this concentration the carotenoid per se did not have any effect on HO-1. Interestingly, the HO-1 repression following TAR plus beta-carotene treatment caused a resynchronization of RAT-1 cell-cycle with a significant increase in the S-phase, and this was probably due to the decreased intracellular levels of carbon monoxide and bilirubin, both of which have antiproliferative effects. The role of HO-1 repression in increasing cell growth was also confirmed in Mv1Lu cells by the \"knock down\" of the Bach1 gene, thus demonstrating as HO-1 repression is a conserved mechanism by which cells can react to oxidative stress.',\n",
              "  'Opposing actions of heat shock protein 90 and 70 regulate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase stability and reactive oxygen species production. OBJECTIVE: Excessive reactive oxygen species contribute to vascular dysfunction. We have previously shown that heat shock protein (Hsp90) inhibitors potently suppress Nox 1 to 3 and 5, and the goals of this study were to identify how molecular chaperones regulate Nox function. METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro, protein expression of Nox 1 to 2, 5 was decreased by Hsp90 inhibitors in multiple cell types (human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and human saphenous vein). In mice treated with Hsp90 inhibitors, Nox1 expression was reduced in lung along with reduced reactive oxygen species from leukocytes. Elevated reactive oxygen species production in obese (db/db) aorta was suppressed by Hsp90 inhibition. Hsp90 inhibitors did not alter Nox5 micro RNA levels, and proteasome inhibition prevented Nox2 and 5 protein degradation and increased ubiquitin incorporation. Inhibition of Hsp90 upregulated the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp70-bound Nox2, 5 and promoted degradation. Silencing Hsp70 prevented Hsp90 inhibitor-mediated degradation of Nox5. The Hsp70-regulated ubiquitin ligase, carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), also bound Nox5 and promoted increased Nox5 ubiquitination and degradation. The chaperone binding and ubiquitination domains of CHIP were required, and the silencing of CHIP blunted Hsp90 inhibitor-mediated degradation of Nox2 and 5. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Hsp90 binds to and regulates Nox protein stability. These actions are opposed by Hsp70 and CHIP, which promote the ubiquitination and degradation of Nox proteins and reduce reactive oxygen species production.',\n",

The maternal allele had a 835T-->C transition in exon 8 (S279P). Phosphoimaging quantitation of the parents' RNAs showed that the steady-state levels of mRNAs of the mutant exons 5 and 8 were 5% and 50%, respectively, of normal levels. The exon 5 mutated allele with the premature translation termination resulted in severe deficiency of Hex A. Transient expression of the exon 8 mutated alpha-chain cDNA in COS-1 cells resulted in deficiency of enzymatic activity. The child exhibited a late-infantile-type disease.\",\n",
              "  'Midazolam and other benzodiazepines. The actions of benzodiazepines are due to the potentiation of the neural inhibition that is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Practically all effects of the benzodiazepines result from their actions on the ionotropic GABA(A) receptors in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines do not activate GABA(A) receptors directly but they require GABA. The main effects of benzodiazepines are sedation, hypnosis, decreased anxiety, anterograde amnesia, centrally mediated muscle relaxation and anti-convulsant activity. In addition to their action on the central nervous system, benzodiazepines have a dose-dependent ventilatory depressant effect and they also cause a modest reduction in arterial blood pressure and an increase in heart rate as a result of a decrease of systemic vascular resistance. The four benzodiazepines, widely used in clinical anaesthesia, are the agonists midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam and the antagonist flumazenil. Midazolam, diazepam and flumazenil are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation whereas lorazepam directly undergoes glucuronide conjugation. CYP3A4 is important in the biotransformation of both midazolam and diazepam. CYP2C19 is important in the biotransformation of diazepam. Liver and renal dysfunction have only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam but they slow down the elimination of the other benzodiazepines used in clinical anaesthesia. The duration of action of all benzodiazepines is strongly dependent on the duration of their administration. Based on clinical studies and computer simulations, midazolam has the shortest recovery profile followed by lorazepam and diazepam. Being metabolized by CYP enzymes, midazolam and diazepam have many clinically significant interactions with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and 2C19. In addition to pharmacokinetic interactions, benzodiazepines have synergistic interactions with other hypnotics and opioids. Midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam are widely used for sedation and to some extent also for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose.',\n",

              "  \"RNAs mediating cotranslational insertion of selenocysteine in eukaryotic selenoproteins. Selenocysteine, a selenium-containing analog of cysteine, is found in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms in active sites of enzymes involved in oxidation-reduction reactions. Its biosynthesis and cotranslational insertion into selenoproteins is performed by an outstanding mechanism, implying the participation of several gene products. The tRNA(Sec) is one of these. In eukaryotes, its transcription mode by RNA polymerase III differs from that of classical tRNA genes, both at the level of the promoter elements and transcription factors involved. In addition, enhanced transcription is afforded by a newly characterized zinc finger activator. Not only transcription of the gene, but also the tRNA(Sec) itself is atypical since its 2D and 3D structures exhibit features which set it apart from classical tRNAs. Decoding of eukaryotic selenocysteine UGA codons requires a stem-loop structure in the 3'UTR of mRNAs, the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element. Structure probing and sequence comparisons led us to propose a 2D structure model for the SECIS element, containing a novel RNA motif composed of four consecutive non-Watson-Crick base-pairs. A 3D model, rationalizing the accessibility data, was elaborated by computer modeling. It yields indicative or suggestive evidence for the role that could play some conserved residues and/or structural features in SECIS function. These might act as signals for interaction with SBP, the SECIS binding protein that we have characterized.\",\n",

Seven members of an Ashkenazi Jewish family with Gaucher disease in 3 successive generations were tested for the presence of the 2 common mutations known to occur in the glucocerebrosidase gene. Genomic DNA from blood or skin fibroblasts of relatives was amplified by using the PCR technique and individual mutations identified by oligonucleotides specific to the mutated sequences. Four individuals were homozygous for a mutation at amino acid 370 (370 mutation) known to occur only in type 1 disease. The other 3 affected relatives were compound heterozygotes for this mutation and for a mutation at amino acid 444 (NciI mutation) which, in the homozygous state, is associated with neurological disease. Clinical severity was more marked in the compound heterozygotes than in the homozygotes. Since the mutation is present in Ashkenazim, molecular diagnosis in families which carry the NciI mutation should prove useful in assessing their risk of the neurologic forms of Gaucher disease.',\n",

We evaluated secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: In two phase 3, double-blind, 52-week trials, ERASURE (Efficacy of Response and Safety of Two Fixed Secukinumab Regimens in Psoriasis) and FIXTURE (Full Year Investigative Examination of Secukinumab vs. Etanercept Using Two Dosing Regimens to Determine Efficacy in Psoriasis), we randomly assigned 738 patients (in the ERASURE study) and 1306 patients (in the FIXTURE study) to subcutaneous secukinumab at a dose of 300 mg or 150 mg (administered once weekly for 5 weeks, then every 4 weeks), placebo, or (in the FIXTURE study only) etanercept at a dose of 50 mg (administered twice weekly for 12 weeks, then once weekly). The objective of each study was to show the superiority of secukinumab over placebo at week 12 with respect to the proportion of patients who had a reduction of 75% or more from baseline in the psoriasis area-and-severity index score (PASI 75) and a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on a 5-point modified investigator's global assessment (coprimary end points). RESULTS: The proportion of patients who met the criterion for PASI 75 at week 12 was higher with each secukinumab dose than with placebo or etanercept: in the ERASURE study, the rates were 81.6% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 71.6% with 150 mg of secukinumab, and 4.5% with placebo; in the FIXTURE study, the rates were 77.1% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 67.0% with 150 mg of secukinumab, 44.0% with etanercept, and 4.9% with placebo (P<0.001 for each secukinumab dose vs. comparators). The proportion of patients with a response of 0 or 1 on the modified investigator's global assessment at week 12 was higher with each secukinumab dose than with placebo or etanercept: in the ERASURE study, the rates were 65.3% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 51.2% with 150 mg of secukinumab, and 2.4% with placebo; in the FIXTURE study, the rates were 62.5% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 51.1% with 150 mg of secukinumab, 27.2% with etanercept, and 2.8% with placebo (P<0.001 for each secukinumab dose vs. comparators). The rates of infection were higher with secukinumab than with placebo in both studies and were similar to those with etanercept. CONCLUSIONS: Secukinumab was effective for psoriasis in two randomized trials, validating interleukin-17A as a therapeutic target.

              "  'Isolation of the gene for McLeod syndrome that encodes a novel membrane transport protein. McLeod syndrome is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. We have assembled a cosmid contig of 360 kb that encompasses the McLeod gene locus. A 50 kb deletion was detected by screening DNA from patients with radiolabeled whole cosmids, and two transcription units were identified within this deletion. The mRNA expression pattern of one of them, designated as XK, correlates closely to the McLeod phenotype. XK encodes a novel protein with structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane transport proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis of XK from two unrelated McLeod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites. These findings provide direct evidence that XK is responsible for McLeod syndrome.',\n",
              "  \"Tofacitinib: The First Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety, dosage administration, and adverse effects of tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. DATA SOURCES: Primary sources of information were obtained from clinical studies, which were identified through PubMed (1966 to June 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to March 2013) using terms: tofacitinib, tasocitinib, CP-690550, and CP-690,550. Information was used from tofacitinib package insert, guidelines, and published abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Data search was limited to include publications in English language and from human subjects. DATA SYNTHESIS: Tofacitinib is the first oral Janus kinase inhibitor indicated for treatment of moderate to severe RA. Tofacitinib demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Tofacitinib was efficacious in RA patients, indicated by achievements of ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 criteria. Similar improvements were observed in patients who met remission criteria based on the Disease Activity Scores 28 criteria and quality of life as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Tofacitinib was associated with infections and malignancies; and elevations in serum creatinine and lipids were observed. Drug interactions with inducers and inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 and 2C9 isoenzymes were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib is an oral treatment option for RA patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. Postmarket surveillance will provide further insight to tofacitinib's role in RA therapy, especially in patients who may require different types of combination therapy with DMARDS.\",\n",
              "  'Heme mediates derepression of Maf recognition element through direct binding to transcription repressor Bach1. Heme controls expression of genes involved in the synthesis of globins and heme. The mammalian transcription factor Bach1 functions as a repressor of the Maf recognition element (MARE) by forming antagonizing hetero-oligomers with the small Maf family proteins. We show here that heme binds specifically to Bach1 and regulates its DNA-binding activity. Deletion studies demonstrated that a heme-binding region of Bach1 is confined within its C-terminal region that possesses four dipeptide cysteine-proline (CP) motifs. Mutations in all of the CP motifs of Bach1 abolished its interaction with heme. The DNA-binding activity of Bach1 as a MafK hetero-oligomer was markedly inhibited by heme in gel mobility shift assays. The repressor activity of Bach1 was lost upon addition of hemin in transfected cells. These results suggest that increased levels of heme inactivate the repressor Bach1, resulting in induction of a host of genes with MARES:',\n",
              "  'The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Cancer stem cells (CSC) are rare drug-resistant cancer cell subsets proposed to be responsible for the maintenance and recurrence of cancer and metastasis. Telomerase is constitutively active in both bulk tumor cell and CSC populations but has only limited expression in normal tissues. Thus, inhibition of telomerase has been shown to be a viable approach in controlling cancer growth in nonclinical studies and is currently in phase II clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited. Additionally, imetelstat treatment reduced the CSC fractions present in the breast and pancreatic cell lines. In vitro treatment with imetelstat, but not control oligonucleotides, also reduced the proliferation and self-renewal potential of MCF7 mammospheres and resulted in cell death after <4 weeks of treatment. In vitro treatment of PANC1 cells showed reduced tumor engraftment in nude mice, concomitant with a reduction in the CSC levels. Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations. Our results suggest that imetelstat-mediated depletion of CSCs may offer an alternative mechanism by which telomerase inhibition may be exploited for cancer therapy.',\n",
              "  'Microsporidian infection in a free-living marine nematode. Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites. Although nematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse animal groups, the only confirmed report of microsporidian infection was that of the \"nematode killer\" (Nematocida parisii). N. parisii was isolated from a wild Caenorhabditis sp. and causes an acute and lethal intestinal infection in a lab strain of Caenorhabditis elegans. We set out to characterize a microsporidian infection in a wild nematode to determine whether the infection pattern of N. parisii in the lab is typical of microsporidian infections in nematodes. We describe a novel microsporidian species named Sporanauta perivermis (marine spore of roundworms) and characterize its infection in its natural host, the free-living marine nematode Odontophora rectangula. S. perivermis is not closely related to N. parisii and differs strikingly in all aspects of infection. Examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the infection was localized in the hypodermal and muscle tissues only and did not involve the intestines. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed infection in the muscle and hypodermis, and surprisingly, it also revealed that the parasite infects O. rectangula eggs, suggesting a vertical mode of transmission. Our observations highlight the importance of studying parasites in their natural hosts and indicate that not all nematode-infecting microsporidia are \"nematode killers\"; instead, microsporidiosis can be more versatile and chronic in the wild.',\n",
              "  'Role of orally available antagonists of factor Xa in the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disease: focus on rivaroxaban. Interpatient variability in the safety and efficacy of oral anticoagulation with warfarin presents several challenges to clinicians, thus underscoring the emergent need for new orally available anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and ability to target circulating clotting factors. Seven compounds including rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, and eribaxaban are orally available direct inhibitors of activated factor X currently in development for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism and for thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation or following an acute coronary syndrome. At doses used in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, rivaroxaban and apixaban demonstrated a predictable onset of effect, maximal plasma concentration, and half-life that was unaffected by age, renal, or hepatic disease. In clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, rivaroxaban and apixaban produced equivalent or superior reductions in the development or progression of venous thromboembolism compared with either low molecular weight heparin or warfarin. Trials comparing the efficacy of rivaroxaban or apixaban to standard therapy for stroke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation are in process. Rivaroxaban, the sentinel compound in this class, is already approved in the European Union and Canada. It is likely to be approved for use in the United States in 2010.',\n",
              "  \"In vitro and in vivo analysis of a JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis. Multiple cytokines play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The appropriate intracellular signalling pathways must be activated via cytokine receptors on the cell surface, and the tyrosine kinases transduce the first 'outside to in' signals to be phosphorylated after receptor binding to its ligand. Among them, members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family are essential for the signalling pathways of various cytokines and are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. The in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo effects of a JAK inhibitor CP-690,550 (tofacitinib) for the treatment of RA are reported. In vitro experiments indicated that the effects of tofacitinib were mediated through suppression of interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon γ production and proliferation of CD4 T cells, presumably Th1 and Th17. A treatment study was conducted in the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-HuRAg mice, an RA animal model using SCID mice implanted with synovium and cartilage from patients. Tofacitinib reduced serum levels of human IL-6 and IL-8 in the mice and also reduced synovial inflammation and invasion into the implanted cartilage. A phase 2 double-blind study using tofacitinib was carried out in Japanese patients with active RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). A total of 140 patients were randomised to tofacitinib 1, 3, 5, 10 mg or placebo twice daily and the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response rate at week 12, a primary end point, was significant for all tofacitinib treatment groups. Thus, an orally available tofacitinib in combination with MTX was efficacious and had a manageable safety profile. Tofacitinib at 5 and 10 mg twice a day appears suitable for further evaluation to optimise the treatment of RA.\",\n",
              "  'The potent calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, telcagepant, does not affect nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation in healthy men. AIMS: To assess the effect of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, telcagepant, on the haemodynamic response to sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG). METHODS: Twenty-two healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period, crossover study. Subjects received 500 mg telcagepant or placebo followed, 1.5 h later, by 0.4 mg NTG. To assess the haemodynamic response the following vascular parameters were measured: blood pressure, aortic augmentation index (AIx) and brachial artery diameter (BAD). Data are presented as mean (95% confidence interval, CI). RESULTS: The aortic AIx following NTG decreased by -18.50 (-21.02, -15.98) % after telcagepant vs. -17.28 (-19.80, -14.76) % after placebo. The BAD fold increase following NTG was 1.14 (1.12, 1.17) after telcagepant vs. 1.13 (1.10, 1.15) after placebo. For both AIx and BAD, the hypothesis that telcagepant does not significantly affect the changes induced by NTG is supported (P < 0.0001). In addition, no vasoconstrictor effect of telcagepant could be demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Telcagepant did not affect NTG-induced haemodynamic changes. These data suggest that NTG-induced vasodilation is not CGRP dependent.',\n",
              "  \"Clinical correlates of 'BRCAness' in triple-negative breast cancer of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: We have previously reported an array comparative genomic hybridization profile that identifies triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), with BRCA1 dysfunction and a high sensitivity to intensified dose bifunctional alkylating agents. To determine the effect of conventional-dose chemotherapy in patients with this so-called BRCA1-like profile, clinical characteristics and survival were studied in a large group of TNBC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA was isolated and BRCA1-like status was assessed in 101 patients with early-stage TNBC receiving adjuvant cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. Clinical characteristics and survival were compared between BRCA1-like and non-BRCA1-like groups. Results Sixty-six tumors (65%) had a BRCA1-like profile. Patients with BRCA1-like tumors tended to be younger and had more often node-negative disease (P = 0.06 and P = 0.03, respectively). Five-year recurrence-free survival was 80% for the BRCA1-like group and 75% for the non-BRCA1-like group (P = 0.35). T stage was the only variable significantly associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1-like tumors share clinical features, like young age at diagnosis and similar nodal status, with breast cancers in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Their prognosis is similar to that of non-BRCA1-like tumors when conventional-dose chemotherapy is administered. TNBCs that are classified as BRCA1-like may contain a defect in homologous recombination and could, in theory, benefit from the addition of poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors.\",\n",
              "  \"Conformational stability of human frataxin and effect of Friedreich's ataxia-related mutations on protein folding. The neurodegenerative disorder FRDA (Friedreich's ataxia) results from a deficiency in frataxin, a putative iron chaperone, and is due to the presence of a high number of GAA repeats in the coding regions of both alleles of the frataxin gene, which impair protein expression. However, some FRDA patients are heterozygous for this triplet expansion and contain a deleterious point mutation on the other allele. In the present study, we investigated whether two particular FRDA-associated frataxin mutants, I154F and W155R, result in unfolded protein as a consequence of a severe structural modification. A detailed comparison of the conformational properties of the wild-type and mutant proteins combining biophysical and biochemical methodologies was undertaken. We show that the FRDA mutants retain the native fold under physiological conditions, but are differentially destabilized as reflected both by their reduced thermodynamic stability and a higher tendency towards proteolytic digestion. The I154F mutant has the strongest effect on fold stability as expected from the fact that the mutated residue contributes to the hydrophobic core formation. Functionally, the iron-binding properties of the mutant frataxins are found to be partly impaired. The apparently paradoxical situation of having clinically aggressive frataxin variants which are folded and are only significantly less stable than the wild-type form in a given adverse physiological stress condition is discussed and contextualized in terms of a mechanism determining the pathology of FRDA heterozygous.\",\n",
              "  'Menin links estrogen receptor activation to histone H3K4 trimethylation. The product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) tumor suppressor gene, menin, is an integral component of MLL1/MLL2 histone methyltransferase complexes specific for Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4). We show that menin is a transcriptional coactivator of the nuclear receptors for estrogen and vitamin D. Activation of the endogenous estrogen-responsive TFF1 (pS2) gene results in promoter recruitment of menin and in elevated trimethylation of H3K4. Knockdown of menin reduces both activated TFF1 (pS2) transcription and H3K4 trimethylation. In addition, menin can directly interact with the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) in a hormone-dependent manner. The majority of disease-related MEN1 mutations prevent menin-ERalpha interaction. Importantly, ERalpha-interacting mutants are also defective in coactivator function. Our results indicate that menin is a critical link between recruitment of histone methyltransferase complexes and nuclear receptor-mediated transcription.',\n",
              "  'TBC1D7 is a third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1. The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. Sequencing analyses of samples from TSC patients suggest that TBC1D7 is unlikely to represent TSC3. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.',\n",
              "  'The p73 gene is an anti-tumoral target of the RARbeta/gamma-selective retinoid tazarotene. Tazarotene, a member of the new class of acetylenic retinoids, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of several hyperproliferative skin diseases, including non-melanoma skin cancer. Its effectiveness is thought to rely on the ability to activate retinoic acid receptors beta and gamma and to induce a number of downstream anti-proliferative genes. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73 is a target of tazarotene. Indeed, tazarotene modulates the expression of the p73 gene in immortalized keratinocyte cell lines by inducing the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative TAp73 isoforms and by repressing the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative DeltaNp73 isoforms. This occurs at the transcriptional level through a coordinated action on P1p73 and P2p73 promoters that control the expression of TA and DeltaN isoforms, respectively. The selective downregulation of DeltaNp73 expression by small interfering RNA led to an enhancement of tazarotene-induced bax activation and apoptosis, whereas the downregulation of both TA and DeltaN isoforms impairs tazarotene-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate the relevance of p73 gene products in tazarotene-induced growth inhibition and effectiveness in the treatment of skin tumors.',\n",

Well-documented drawbacks of traditional anticoagulants have lead to the quest for an ideal anticoagulant resulting in a surge of novel anticoagulant molecules. These newer agents directly target specific steps in coagulation cascade and include newer low molecular weight heparins (adomiparin), ultra low molecular weight heparins (semuloparin, RO-14), inhibitors of activated factor II (dabigatran, AZD0837), X (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), IX (REG1,2), XI (antisense oligonucleotides, BMS 262084, clavatadine A), VII/tissue factor (tifacogin, PCI 274836, and BMS 593214), V (recomodulin, solulin), VIII (TB402), dual thrombin/factor X inhibitors (EP21709, tanogitran), and newer vitamin K antagonists (tecarfarin).

              "  'Calsequestrin, a calcium sequestering protein localized at the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is not essential for body-wall muscle function in Caenorhabditis elegans. Calsequestrin is the major calcium-binding protein of cardiac and skeletal muscles whose function is to sequester Ca(2+ )in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Here we describe the identification and functional characterization of a C. elegans calsequestrin gene (csq-1). CSQ-1 shows moderate similarity (50% similarity, 30% identity) to rabbit skeletal calsequestrin. Unlike mammals, which have two different genes encoding cardiac and fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoforms, csq-1 is the only calsequestrin gene in the C. elegans genome. We show that csq-1 is highly expressed in the body-wall muscles, beginning in mid-embryogenesis and maintained through the adult stage. In body-wall muscle cells, CSQ-1 is localized to sarcoplasmic membranes surrounding sarcomeric structures, in the regions where ryanodine receptors (UNC-68) are located. Mutation in UNC-68 affects CSQ-1 localization, suggesting that the two possibly interact in vivo. Genetic analyses of chromosomal deficiency mutants deleting csq-1 show that CSQ-1 is not essential for initiation of embryonic muscle formation and contraction. Furthermore, double-stranded RNA injection resulted in animals completely lacking CSQ-1 in body-wall muscles with no observable defects in locomotion. These findings suggest that although CSQ-1 is one of the major calcium-binding proteins in the body-wall muscles of C. elegans, it is not essential for body-wall muscle formation and contraction.',\n",
              "  'Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in healthy male volunteers: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1 trial. BACKGROUND: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity in a 1:1 molar ratio. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of increasing doses of idarucizumab for the reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in a two-part phase 1 study (rising-dose assessment and dose-finding, proof-of-concept investigation). Here we present the results of the proof-of-concept part of the study. METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, proof-of-concept phase 1 study, we enrolled healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years) with a body-mass index of 18·5-29·9 kg/m(2) into one of four dose groups at SGS Life Sciences Clinical Research Services, Belgium. Participants were randomly assigned within groups in a 3:1 ratio to idarucizumab or placebo using a pseudorandom number generator and a supplied seed number. Participants and care providers were masked to treatment assignment. All participants received oral dabigatran etexilate 220 mg twice daily for 3 days and a final dose on day 4. Idarucizumab (1 g, 2 g, or 4 g 5-min infusion, or 5 g plus 2·5 g in two 5-min infusions given 1 h apart) was administered about 2 h after the final dabigatran etexilate dose. The primary endpoint was incidence of drug-related adverse events, analysed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of dabigatran etexilate. Reversal of diluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT) were secondary endpoints assessed by measuring the area under the effect curve from 2 h to 12 h (AUEC2-12) after dabigatran etexilate ingestion on days 3 and 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01688830. FINDINGS: Between Feb 23, and Nov 29, 2013, 47 men completed this part of the study. 12 were enrolled into each of the 1 g, 2 g, or 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab groups (nine to idarucizumab and three to placebo in each group), and 11 were enrolled into the 4 g idarucizumab group (eight to idarucizumab and three to placebo). Drug-related adverse events were all of mild intensity and reported in seven participants: one in the 1 g idarucizumab group (infusion site erythema and hot flushes), one in the 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab group (epistaxis); one receiving placebo (infusion site haematoma), and four during dabigatran etexilate pretreatment (three haematuria and one epistaxis). Idarucizumab immediately and completely reversed dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in a dose-dependent manner; the mean ratio of day 4 AUEC2-12 to day 3 AUEC2-12 for dTT was 1·01 with placebo, 0·26 with 1 g idarucizumab (74% reduction), 0·06 with 2 g idarucizumab (94% reduction), 0·02 with 4 g idarucizumab (98% reduction), and 0·01 with 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab (99% reduction). No serious or severe adverse events were reported, no adverse event led to discontinuation of treatment, and no clinically relevant difference in incidence of adverse events was noted between treatment groups. INTERPRETATION: These phase 1 results show that idarucizumab was associated with immediate, complete, and sustained reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in healthy men, and was well tolerated with no unexpected or clinically relevant safety concerns, supporting further testing. Further clinical studies are in progress. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG.',\n",

We used [18F]altanserin and positron emission tomography (PET) to image serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in humans. The highest [18F]altanserin uptake is found in the cerebral cortex, with specific-to-nonspecific binding ratios varying from 0.53 to 1.91 in humans between 24 and 48 years of age. In all neocortical regions studied, [18F]altanserin uptake correlates negatively with age. No correlations were found between age and uptake in the cerebellum, the regional cerebral blood flow, or the time course of metabolization of [18F]altanserin. The reduction in cerebral 5-HT2A receptor binding thus directly reflects the loss of specific 5-HT2A receptors with age.',\n",

We transplanted adult whole bone marrow prelabeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the ischemic boundary zone of the adult rat brain at 1 day after 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Approximately 3.3% of 10(6) transplanted bone marrow cells were BrdU reactive at 14 days after MCAo. BrdU-reactive cells expressed neuronal and astrocytic proteins, neuronal nuclei protein (NeuN, 1%), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 5%) immunoreactivities, respectively. In addition, bone marrow transplantation promoted proliferation of ependymal and subependymal cells, identified by nestin (a neuroepithelial stem cell marker), within the ventricular zone and subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ). These data suggest that intracerebral transplantation of bone marrow could potentially be used to induce plasticity in ischemic brain.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of siltuximab on the interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway in ovarian epithelial carcinoma. METHODS: (1) Expressions of IL-6 in ovarian cancer patient specimens were assessed by immunohistochemistry. (2) Expression of phosphorylation Stat3 (pStat3) protein in siltuximab and IL-6 treated SKOV3 cell lines was determined by western blot, and expression levels of Stat3-induced bcl-XL, MCL-1, survivin, in siltuximab treated SKOV3/TR and CAOV3/TR cells lines were also determined by western blot. (3) Real-time image analysis was used to study the nuclear translocation of pEGFP-Stat3 fusion protein in ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3-pEGFP-Stat3 treated with siltuximab and IL-6. (4) Paclitaxel sensitivity in siltuximab treated SKOV3/TR and CAOV3/TR cell lines were assessed using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). The 50% inhibiting concentration (IC(50)) was defined as the paclitaxel concentration required to decrease the A(490) value to 50%. RESULTS: (1) There were significantly difference in IL-6 staining density and the positive rate of IL-6 protein stained among the metastatic, and drug-resistant recurrent tumors, and matched primary tumors [69% (18/26)] vs. 77% (20/26) vs. 23% (6/26), P < 0.05]. (2)A clear increase in Stat3 phosphorylation levels was observed in the IL-6-treated SKOV3 cell lines as compared to the SKOV3 cell lines. When the IL-6-treated SKOV3 cells were incubated with siltuximab with a range of concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 µg/ml, there were trends toward reduced pStat3 expression in the treated cell lines. Compared without treatment with siltuximab, the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1, bcl-XL and survivin in SKOV3/TR and CAOV3/TR cell lines were significantly decreased after treated with siltuximab. (3) In resting cells, the majority of pEGFP-Stat3 was cytoplasmic until the addition of human IL-6, which promptly induced the translocation of fluorescent Stat3 molecules to the nucleus. Exposure of cells to siltuximab with a range of concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 µg/ml, followed by an incubation in IL-6 significantly reduced pEGFP-Stat3 nucleocytoplasmic translocation. (4) MTT cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that siltuximab increased paclitaxel-induced cell death and partially overcame paclitaxel resistance. Treated with siltuximab (1 and 10 µg/ml), the paclitaxel IC(50) value of siltuximab in SKOV3/TR (0.49, 0.19 µg/ml) and CAOV3/TR (0.0010, 0.0008 µg/ml) cells were significantly lower than those in untreated cells (0.71, 0.0021 µg/ml; all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that siltuximab effectively block the IL-6 signaling pathways, which. Blockage of IL-6 signaling may provide benefits for the treatment of ovarian cancer.',\n",
              "  \"The role of Ser129 phosphorylation of α-synuclein in neurodegeneration of Parkinson's disease: a review of in vivo models. Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. The motor impairments of Parkinson's disease are caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and associated with the appearance of fibrillar aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn) called Lewy bodies. Approximately 90% of α-syn deposited in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). In contrast, only 4% or less of total α-syn is phosphorylated at this residue in the normal brain. This suggests that the accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated α-syn leads to the formation of Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Our laboratory and others have performed experiments using in vivo models of Parkinson's disease to elucidate the role of increased Ser129 phosphorylation in α-syn neurotoxicity. However, there has been a lack of consistency among these models. In this review, we summarize the main findings regarding the relationship between Ser129 phosphorylation and α-syn neurotoxicity, and examine the differences among models. We further discuss the role of Ser129 phosphorylation in α-syn aggregation and the future directions to test the potential of Ser129 phosphorylation as a therapeutic target for slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease.\",\n",
              "  'Phosphorylation of c-Fos by members of the p38 MAPK family. Role in the AP-1 response to UV light. Exposure to sources of UV radiation, such as sunlight, induces a number of cellular alterations that are highly dependent on its ability to affect gene expression. Among them, the rapid activation of genes coding for two subfamilies of proto-oncoproteins, Fos and Jun, which constitute the AP-1 transcription factor, plays a key role in the subsequent regulation of expression of genes involved in DNA repair, cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, death by apoptosis, and tissue and extracellular matrix remodeling proteases. Besides being regulated at the transcriptional level, Jun and Fos transcriptional activities are also regulated by phosphorylation as a result of the activation of intracellular signaling cascades. In this regard, the phosphorylation of c-Jun by UV-induced JNK has been readily documented, whereas a role for Fos proteins in UV-mediated responses and the identification of Fos-activating kinases has remained elusive. Here we identify p38 MAPKs as proteins that can associate with c-Fos and phosphorylate its transactivation domain both in vitro and in vivo. This phosphorylation is transduced into changes in its transcriptional ability as p38-activated c-Fos enhances AP1-driven gene expression. Our findings indicate that as a consequence of the activation of stress pathways induced by UV light, endogenous c-Fos becomes a substrate of p38 MAPKs and, for the first time, provide evidence that support a critical role for p38 MAPKs in mediating stress-induced c-Fos phosphorylation and gene transcription activation. Using a specific pharmacological inhibitor for p38alpha and -beta, we found that most likely these two isoforms mediate UV-induced c-Fos phosphorylation in vivo. Thus, these newly described pathways act concomitantly with the activation of c-Jun by JNK/MAPKs, thereby contributing to the complexity of AP1-driven gene transcription regulation.',\n",
              "  'Phenotypic and molecular analyses of X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (\"lubag\") in women. BACKGROUND: X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) or \"lubag\" is an X-linked recessive disorder that afflicts Filipino men, and rarely, women. Genetic confirmation is performed through haplotyping or detection of disease-specific changes in the DYT3 gene. OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenotypes and molecular data of 8 symptomatic female patients with XDP from 5 kindreds. METHODS: Case series. RESULTS: The average age of onset of symptoms was 52 years (range, 26-75 years). Six of 8 patients had parkinsonism, whereas only 1 had dystonia. The initial symptom was focal tremor or parkinsonism in 4, chorea in 3, and focal dystonia (cervical) in 1. Seven of 8 patients had slow or no progression of their symptoms and required no treatment. The patient with disabling parkinsonism was responsive to carbidopa/levodopa. Seven were heterozygous for the XDP haplotype, whereas 1 was homozygous. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypes of female patients with XDP may include parkinsonism, dystonia, myoclonus, tremor, and chorea. The dystonia, if present, is mild and usually nonprogressive. Similar to men with XDP, parkinsonism is a frequent symptom in women. In contrast to men, affected women have a more benign phenotype, older age of onset, and milder course. Extreme X-inactivation mosaic may be a cause of symptoms in women with XDP, but a homozygously affected woman has also been observed.',\n",

Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a high-throughput method for transcriptome analysis that provides a single base-pair resolution map of transcription start sites (TSS) and their relative usage. Despite their high resolution and functional significance, published CAGE data are still underused in promoter analysis due to the absence of tools that enable its efficient manipulation and integration with other genome data types. Here we present CAGEr, an R implementation of novel methods for the analysis of differential TSS usage and promoter dynamics, integrated with CAGE data processing and promoterome mining into a first comprehensive CAGE toolbox on a common analysis platform. Crucially, we provide collections of TSSs derived from most published CAGE datasets, as well as direct access to FANTOM5 resource of TSSs for numerous human and mouse cell/tissue types from within R, greatly increasing the accessibility of precise context-specific TSS data for integrative analyses.

              "  'The p53 tumor suppressor gene and nuclear protein: basic science review and relevance in the management of bladder cancer. PURPOSE: An extensive body of literature regarding p53 has accumulated during the last 2 decades. The cellular mechanisms of p53 are complex yet well-defined, whereas its clinical usefulness in the management of bladder cancer remains controversial. We outline the basic constitutive functions of p53 and summarize its current role in the management of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE based literature review concerning the fundamental mechanisms of p53 and its role in the management of bladder cancer. RESULTS: The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that acts as \"guardian of the genome.\" Many diverse cellular events, including DNA damage and hypoxia, activate the p53 gene. The p53 protein functions as a transcription factor, regulating downstream genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and programmed cell death. Loss of p53 function confers genomic instability, impaired apoptosis and diminished cell cycle restraint. Therefore, p53 mutations select for certain critical features of malignancy. Alteration of P53 is the most common mutation in human cancer. Roughly half of all human malignancies, including many urological cancers, exhibit p53 mutations. In bladder cancer p53 mutations have been associated with higher tumor grade and advanced stage, as well as progression of superficial disease to muscle invasion. Moreover, p53 nuclear over expression appears to be an independent predictor of disease progression and decreased survival after cystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of p53 mutation in tumor cell biology is irrefutable. Wild-type p53 mediates imperative functions such as regulation of the cell cycle and programmed cell death. Deficiency of p53 function by mutation or inactivation abrogates normal cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis, generating a favorable milieu for genomic instability and carcinogenesis. However, despite the manifest importance of p53 in human malignancy, its current role in the management of bladder cancer appears somewhat limited. A multitude of retrospective studies have associated p53 mutations with adverse outcomes in superficial and muscle invasive disease. Nonetheless, randomized prospective studies are needed to determine the potential clinical implications of p53 in bladder cancer.',\n",

To control the enzymatic activity of vSET in vivo with an engineered S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) analogue as methyl donor cofactor, we have carried out structure-guided design, synthesis, and characterization of orthogonal vSET methyltransferase mutant/SAM analogue pairs using a \"bump-and-hole\" strategy.',\n",
              "  'Dimerization of DNA methyltransferase 1 is mediated by its regulatory domain. DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification and plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. Within the family of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts), Dnmt3a and 3b establish methylation marks during early development, while Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns after DNA replication. The maintenance function of Dnmt1 is regulated by its large regulatory N-terminal domain that interacts with other chromatin factors and is essential for the recognition of hemi-methylated DNA. Gelfiltration analysis showed that purified Dnmt1 elutes at an apparent molecular weight corresponding to the size of a dimer. With protein interaction assays we could show that Dnmt1 interacts with itself through its N-terminal regulatory domain. By deletion analysis and co-immunoprecipitations we mapped the dimerization domain to the targeting sequence TS that is located in the center of the N-terminal domain (amino acids 310-629) and was previously shown to mediate replication independent association with heterochromatin at chromocenters. Further mutational analyses suggested that the dimeric complex has a bipartite interaction interface and is formed in a head-to-head orientation. Dnmt1 dimer formation could facilitate the discrimination of hemi-methylated target sites as has been found for other palindromic DNA sequence recognizing enzymes. These results assign an additional function to the TS domain and raise the interesting question how these functions are spatially and temporarily co-ordinated.',\n",

Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has been used for patients with refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia. We used bortezomib in ten refractory or relapsed patients (seven of multiple myeloma, two of lymphoma and one of acute myeloblastic leukemia). Six out of ten (60%) patients developed varicella herpes zoster after the complete of one cycle of bortezomib. The incidence of varicella herpes zoster was higher than reported in the literature. It may be due to immunosuppression caused by the combination of high-dose dexamethasone or other drugs. We considered that prophylactic antiviral medication could be used in predisposed patients to reduce the incidence of varicella herpes zoster.',\n",
              "  'Craniofacial and oral features of Sotos syndrome: differences in patients with submicroscopic deletion and mutation of NSD1 gene. Sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of NSD1 gene located at 5q35. There are two types of mutations that cause NSD1 haploinsufficiency: mutations within the NSD1 gene (mutation type) and a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion encompassing the entire NSD1 gene (deletion type). We investigated detailed craniofacial, dental, and oral findings in five patients with deletion type, and three patients with mutation type Sotos syndrome. All eight patients had a high palate, excessive tooth wear, crowding, and all but one patient had hypodontia and deep bite. Hypodontia was exclusively observed in the second premolars, and there were no differences between the deletion and mutation types in the number of missing teeth. Another feature frequently seen in common with both types was maxillary recession. Findings seen more frequently and more pronounced in deletion-type than in mutation-type included mandibular recession, scissors or posterior cross bite, and small dental arch with labioclination of the maxillary central incisors. It is noteworthy that although either scissors bite or cross bite was present in all of the deletion-type patients, neither of these was observed in mutation-type patients. Other features seen in a few patients include enamel hypoplasia (two deletion patients), and ectopic tooth eruption (one deletion and one mutation patients). Our study suggests that Sotos syndrome patients should be observed closely for possible dental and oral complications especially for malocculusion in the deletion-type patients.',\n",
              "  'A new model for dermatitis herpetiformis that uses HLA-DQ8 transgenic NOD mice. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with gluten sensitivity. It presents as a papulovesicular rash and is often associated with enteropathy. The rash resolves when the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet and/or dapsone. DH, as well as celiac disease, is tightly associated with DQ2 and DQ8. A novel mouse model for DH is described that utilizes the NOD background and the HLA-DQ8 transgene. The addition of DQ8 contributes sensitivity to gliadin, and the addition of the NOD background contributes to autoimmunity and pathogenesis. Fifteen NOD DQ8+ mice of 90 that were sensitized to gluten developed blistering pathology similar to that seen in DH. Neutrophil infiltration of the dermis, deposition of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction, and a complete reversal of the blistering phenomenon with the administration of a gluten-free diet with or without dapsone were observed. None of the 3 blistering mice examined had small-bowel pathology. This animal model of DH will be useful to determine the specificity of the IgA deposits, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms that occur in the skin as a result of gluten ingestion.',\n",
              "  'Mdm2-mediated NEDD8 modification of TAp73 regulates its transactivation function. Mutations in p73 are rare in cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that the relative expression of various p73 isoforms may contribute to tumorigenesis. Alternative promoters and N-terminal splicing result in the transcription and processing of either full-length (TA) or N-terminally truncated (deltaN) p73 isoforms. TAp73 possesses pro-apoptotic functions, while deltaNp73 has anti-apoptotic properties via functional inhibition of TAp73 and p53. Here, we report that TAp73, but not deltaNp73, is covalently modified by NEDD8 under physiologic conditions in an Mdm2-dependent manner. Co-expression of NEDP1, a cysteine protease that specifically cleaves NEDD8 conjugates, was shown to deneddylate TAp73. In addition, blockage of the endogenous NEDD8 pathway increased TAp73-mediated transactivation of p53- and p73-responsive promoter-driven reporter activity, and in conjunction, neddylated TAp73 species were found preferentially in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Mdm2 attenuates TAp73 transactivation function, at least in part, by promoting NEDD8-dependent TAp73 cytoplasmic localization and provide the first evidence of a covalent post-translational modification exclusively targeting the TA isoforms of p73.',\n",
              "  \"Mepolizumab: 240563, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, SB 240563. Mepolizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody that is in clinical trials with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for the treatment of severe asthma, nasal polyposis and hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic oesophagitis (the latter two indications are classed as eosinophilia in the phase table). Interleukin-5 stimulates the production, activation and maturation of eosinophils. Since mepolizumab inhibits interleukin-5 and has a long terminal half-life, treatment with mepolizumab causes a sustained reduction in the numbers of circulating eosinophils. Thus, mepolizumab may be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of conditions characterized by increased levels of eosinophils. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare idiopathic disease with broad clinical signs and symptoms that is diagnosed based on a persistent blood eosinophil count of >1500 cells, various end-organ damages (including skin, heart, lung, nervous system and digestive system), and with exclusion of known secondary causes of hypereosinophilia. Mepolizumab is in clinical trials for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome, eosinophilc oesophagitis, severe asthma (in patients with airway eosinophilia) and nasal polyposis. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has completed enrolment in a phase II study of mepolizumab in 20 patients with symptomatic eosinophilic bronchitis with or without asthma in Canada. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is evaluating the effects of intravenous mepolizumab on asthma control, airway eosinophilia and the degree to which concomitant corticosteroid treatment can be reduced (NCT00292877). In previous clinical studies, including trials in the EU and US, mepolizumab has shown a lack of effect on allergen-induced airway responses and inflammation despite a significant reduction in blood and sputum eosinophil levels.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III study of mepolizumab over 9 months in 85 patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome was completed in 2006. All patients have been offered, and continued in, a phase III, open-label, long-term extension study of mepolizumab. Enrolment in this study was completed in September 2006.A phase III, compassionate use trial of mepalizumab (NCT00244686) in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome was ongoing in October 2007 in the US. Patients who have significant clinical disease but are unresponsive to traditional treatment and those who have demonstrated clinical benefit from previous anti-IL-5 treatment are eligible to take part in the trial. Mepolizumab received orphan drug status for first-line treatment in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome in the US and the EU in 2004. Mepolizumab is also in phase I/II clinical development for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis. A phase I/II trial (NCT00358449) began in August 2006 in the US, Australia, the UK and Canada, and will enrol approximately 72 paediatric patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis. The randomized, parallel-group clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous mepolizumab for 12 weeks. In September 2006, GSK completed enrolment in a phase I/II study of mepolizumab for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis in ten adult patients in Switzerland (NCT00274703). The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of IV mepolizumab.A phase I/II trial of mepolizumab in four patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis conducted by Cincinnati Children's hospital found the monoclonal antibody was safe and effective. Brigham and Women's Hospital in association with GSK is conducting a phase I/II trial of mepolizumab in patients with Churg-Strauss Syndrome (CSS) in the US. The trial, which started in September 2007, will evaluate the potential of mepolizumab to reduce the need for corticosteroid therapy in patients with CSS (NCT00527566). CSS, otherwise known as allergic granulomatosis, is defined by patients with asthma, eosinophilia and vasculitis.\",\n",
              "  'Mutational screening of RET, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, AKT1, and CTNNB1 in medullary thyroid carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Screening medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs) for rearranged during transfection (RET) mutations becomes increasingly important for clinical assessment of the disease. The role of mutations in other genes including RAS (i.e. HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS), v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT1), and CTNNB1 (β-catenin) is unknown or not fully explored yet for this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material was the primary source for screening 13 sporadic and inherited MTCs and matched non-tumor specimens. Multiplex PCR was included in the PCR protocol. Sequence analysis encompassed mutational hotspot regions in RET exons 5, 8, 10, 11, and 13 to 16; HRAS exons 1 and 2; KRAS exons 1 and 2; NRAS exons 1 and 2; BRAF exon 15; AKT1 exon 2, and CTNNB1 exon 3. RESULTS: We identified RET mutations in seven of 13 MTCs: five RET-positive cases revealed a mutation in exon 16 (M918T) and two a mutation in exon 10 (C618S and C620S). In four of the RET-positive cases, the mutation was inherited, out of which three were reportedly associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome, i.e. MEN2A (C618S), MEN2A/familial MTC (FMTC) (C620S), and MEN2B (M918T). These cases reflect the known MEN2 genotype-phenotype correlation. Three of the five stage IVc MTCs were inherited RET-positive cases. Mutational screening in HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, AKT1, and CTNNB1 disclosed one sporadic RET-negative MTC (stage III) with mutation in HRAS codon 13 (G13R). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the clinical relevance of screening MTC patients for RET mutations. The role of RAS mutations, in particular HRAS mutations, in sporadic RET-negative MTC has not been fully explored yet. Mutations in BRAF, AKT1, and CTNNB1 are likely not to play a role in MTC.',\n",
              "  'Effects of the serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphism on mirtazapine and paroxetine efficacy and adverse events in geriatric major depression. BACKGROUND: The \"long/short\"polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been proposed as a pharmacogenetic marker for antidepressant efficacy. Some but not all studies have found that the short form of 5HTTLPR (S allele) results in decreased efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the 5HTTLPR polymorphism influences the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine and paroxetine hydrochloride, 2 frequently prescribed antidepressants with differing pharmacologic profiles, in geriatric depression. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized 8-week study. SETTING: Eighteen academic and private outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: We evaluated 246 cognitively intact patients 65 years or older with major depression. INTERVENTIONS: Antidepressant therapy with 15 to 45 mg/d of mirtazapine (n = 124) or 20 to 40 mg/d of paroxetine (n = 122). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 and Geriatric Depression Scale, severity of adverse events and dosing compliance indexes, and discontinuations due to adverse events. Outcome measures were stratified according to 5HTTLPR genotypes. RESULTS: Geriatric Depression Scale scores indicated that S allele carriers treated with paroxetine showed a small impairment in antidepressant response. Among mirtazapine-treated patients, there was little indication that the 5HTTLPR genotype affected antidepressant efficacy. However, the 5HTTLPR polymorphism had a dramatic effect on adverse events. Among paroxetine-treated subjects, S allele carriers experienced more severe adverse events during the course of the study, achieved significantly lower final daily doses, and had more discontinuations at days 14, 21, 28, 42, and 49. Surprisingly, among mirtazapine-treated subjects, S allele carriers had fewer discontinuations due to adverse events, experienced less severe adverse events, and achieved higher final daily doses. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that the S allele of 5HTTLPR at the SLC6A4 locus is associated with a poor outcome after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, the major effect was on the tolerability of these drugs rather than efficacy. Results from mirtazapine-treated patients indicate that the effect of this polymorphism on outcome may depend on the mechanism of antidepressant action.',\n",
              "  'Evaluation of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor - betrixaban. INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therapy for treatment and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The emergence of two new classes of orally administered anticoagulants, direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape in the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between betrixaban and currently available novel anticoagulants and future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acute coronary syndromes is yet to be defined based on clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currently, there are no specific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants. The availability of an effective reversal agent would be very attractive for the management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or the need for emergent surgery.',\n",
              "  'High incidence of iron depletion and restless leg syndrome (RLS) in regular blood donors: intravenous iron sucrose substitution more effective than oral iron. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Iron depletion is common in regular blood donors. The objective of the study was to investigate the frequency and severity of iron depletion in regular blood donors and whether IV iron is more effective than oral to avoid iron depletion and symptoms thereof, especially restless legs syndrome (RLS). METHOD: One hundred and twenty blood donors with at least five previous whole blood donations were randomized to receive either IV iron sucrose (Venofer(®), RenaPharma/Vifor, Uppsala, Sweden), 200 mg, or to 20×100 mg of oral iron sulphate (Duroferon(®), GlaxoSmithKline, Stockholm, Sweden), after each blood donation during 1 year. Iron status and RLS incidence and severity were investigated. RESULTS: Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%). The IV iron group increased storage iron to a greater extent than the oral iron group after 12 months (P=0·0043). Female donors were more responsive to IV iron sucrose compared to oral iron sulphate, particularly female donors below 50 years of age. RLS severity scores were significantly lower in the IV iron group. The two treatments were safe. CONCLUSION: Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient. IV iron sucrose substitutes iron loss in blood donors more efficiently compared with oral iron sulphate, especially in women. Iron substitution to blood donors should be individualized and based on P-ferritin monitoring.',\n",
              "  'Subunit contributions to histone methyltransferase activities of fly and worm polycomb group complexes. The ESC-E(Z) complex of Drosophila melanogaster Polycomb group (PcG) repressors is a histone H3 methyltransferase (HMTase). This complex silences fly Hox genes, and related HMTases control germ line development in worms, flowering in plants, and X inactivation in mammals. The fly complex contains a catalytic SET domain subunit, E(Z), plus three noncatalytic subunits, SU(Z)12, ESC, and NURF-55. The four-subunit complex is >1,000-fold more active than E(Z) alone. Here we show that ESC and SU(Z)12 play key roles in potentiating E(Z) HMTase activity. We also show that loss of ESC disrupts global methylation of histone H3-lysine 27 in fly embryos. Subunit mutations identify domains required for catalytic activity and/or binding to specific partners. We describe missense mutations in surface loops of ESC, in the CXC domain of E(Z), and in the conserved VEFS domain of SU(Z)12, which each disrupt HMTase activity but preserve complex assembly. Thus, the E(Z) SET domain requires multiple partner inputs to produce active HMTase. We also find that a recombinant worm complex containing the E(Z) homolog, MES-2, has robust HMTase activity, which depends upon both MES-6, an ESC homolog, and MES-3, a pioneer protein. Thus, although the fly and mammalian PcG complexes absolutely require SU(Z)12, the worm complex generates HMTase activity from a distinct partner set.',\n",

Malaria, which is the result of Plasmodium falciparum infection, is a global health threat that resulted in 655,000 deaths and 216 million clinical cases in 2010 alone. Recent phase 3 trials with malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) in children has demonstrated modest efficacy against clinical and severe malaria. RTS,S targets the pre-erythrocytic phase of the disease and induces high antibody titers against the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and a moderate CD4(+) T cell response. The individual contribution of these adaptive immune responses to protection from infection remains unknown. Here, we found that prophylactic administration of anti-CSP mAbs derived from an RTS,S-vaccinated recipient fully protected mice with humanized livers from i.v.- and mosquito bite - delivered P. falciparum sporozoite challenge. Titers of anti-CSP that conveyed full protection were within the range observed in human RTS,S vaccine recipients. Increasing anti-CSP titers resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the liver parasite burden. These data indicate that RTS,S-induced antibodies are protective and provide sterilizing immunity against P. falciparum infection when reaching or exceeding a critical plasma concentration.',\n",

Its diagnosis requires identification of the classical triad of symptoms, including hypoacusis, thyroid goitre and iodine organification defect in the thyroid, which may lead to thyroid functional disorders of hypothyroidism. SP is accompanied by anatomical anomalies. The objective is the hearing and balance system evaluation and the analysis of the inner ear structure and also the assessment of the function and structure of thyroid gland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the research four families were qualified, 7 persons with PS, 12 persons altogether. In all the patients the anamnesis in the form of a questionnaire and laryngological examination were performed. It was followed by pure tone, speech and impedance audiometry and brainstem response testing as well. ENG was also conducted. Patients with hearing loss were subjected to magnetic resonance of temporal bone. For the whole group thyroid hormones levels and iodine organification in the thyroid identified in a test with potassium perchlorate were measured and also USG and scyntography were conducted. RESULTS: In audiological examination in 3 cases deafness, in 2 cases profound hypoacusis and in 2 mild hypoacusis were recognised. In the group in 2 patients the hypoacusis was of a mixed type. In radiological assessment the labirynth showed anatomical anomalies in the form of enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct and the endolyphatic sac, yet in 3 patients the anomalies also concerned the structure of cochlear and semicircular canals. Endocrine examination showed hypothyroidism in 5, its subclinical form in 1, diffuse thyroid goitre in 4 and nodular thyroid goiter in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: A complex clinical evaluation: endocrine and audiological, together with radiological diagnostic imaging, supported by molecular studies of SLC26A4 gene, are the procedures, necessary for complete and accurate diagnosis of PS and EVAS.',\n",
              "  'Chronic myeloid leukemia: a historical perspective. Patients with splenomegaly and abnormally high leukocyte counts were first recognized in France, Germany, and Scotland in the 1840s. The only well-documented therapy in the 19th century was use of arsenic in one or other form, which did undoubtedly reduce the leukocyte count but probably did little or nothing to prolong life. These early cases were probably examples of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (then called chronic granulocytic leukemia). In the 20th century important steps in unraveling the pathogenesis of CML were the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome in 1960, and of the (9;22) translocation in 1973. There followed definition of the breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 22 in 1984 and the demonstration of the BCR-ABL transcript in CML in 1985. In the first half of the 20th century patients were treated predominantly with radiotherapy, and later on with busulfan, hydroxycarbamide, or interferon-alfa (IFN-α). From 1980 onwards allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) became the treatment of choice for eligible patients. The era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) began in 1998 and today the use of the original TKI, imatinib, has replaced SCT as initial therapy for patients who present with CML in chronic phase.',\n",
              "  'Seipin promotes adipose tissue fat storage through the ER Ca²⁺-ATPase SERCA. Adipose tissue is central to the regulation of lipid metabolism. Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2), one of the most severe lipodystrophy diseases, is caused by mutation of the Seipin gene. Seipin plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis, but its exact molecular functions are still unknown. Here, we show that Seipin physically interacts with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in both Drosophila and man. SERCA, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pump, is solely responsible for transporting cytosolic calcium into the ER lumen. Like dSeipin, dSERCA cell-autonomously promotes lipid storage in Drosophila fat cells. dSeipin affects dSERCA activity and modulates intracellular calcium homeostasis. Adipose tissue-specific knockdown of the ER-to-cytosol calcium release channel ryanodine receptor (RyR) partially restores fat storage in dSeipin mutants. Our results reveal that Seipin promotes adipose tissue fat storage by regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis.',\n",
              "  '3-[2-[4-(4-[18F]Fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl]-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one . Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiologic roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). It is involved in regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). There are three receptor subtypes within the G protein-coupled 5-HT2 receptor family: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors are abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine nucleus, legmental area, and myelencephalon (5). 5-HT2A receptors are involved in mediation of normal and psychotic states, working memory, regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal cells, sleep, peripheral pain, and cardiovascular functions. 5-HT2B receptors are found mainly in several peripheral tissues, such as the stomach, intestine, and pulmonary smooth muscle, and in the myocardium. In the brain, 5-HT2B receptors are found in discrete nuclei of the cerebellum, lateral septum, dorsal hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and amygdala. 5-HT2C receptors are found in the choroid plexus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and ventromedial thalamus. 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in several psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacologic role of 5-HT2A receptors. There have been several studies to develop specific 5-HT2A radioligands, such as [11C]ketanserin (6), [18F]spiperone (7), [11C]methylspiperone ([11C]NMSP), and [18F]setoperone [PubMed], for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, none has proven specific for 5-HT2A receptors because these compounds also bind to other receptors, such as dopamine receptors and 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivative related to ketanserin, was reported to be a potent inhibitor of 5-HT2A receptors with >100-fold selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (8, 9). This led to the development of 3-[2-[4-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl]-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([18F]altanserin) as a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging in vivo (10).',\n",
              "  'Aberrant nestin expression during ethylnitrosourea-(ENU)-induced neurocarcinogenesis. Nestin is a unique intermediate filament protein. While it is robustly expressed in developing brain, postnatal expression is limited to the brain\\'s subventricular zone (SVZ) and endothelial cells. Reexpression occurs, however, under several pathological conditions, including injury and neoplasia. We hypothesized that nestin would be a sensitive marker of early neoplasia after transplacental exposure of rats to ethylnitrosourea (ENU). Rats of various ages were administered bromodeoxyuridine (BudR) before sacrifice, and brain sections were examined for proliferative cells and several immunohistochemical markers, including nestin. Additional rats were examined after a stab wound injury to assess the expression of two of these markers, GFAP and nestin, in reactive astrocytes. All ENU-induced brain tumors (n = 9) were classified as gliomas (astrocytomas or oligoastrocytomas) based on their histology and immunophenotype. Nestin expression was noted in all tumors examined and was present in tumor cells as well as endothelial cells. During tumor development, we consistently noted nestin-expressing cells bearing multiple processes distributed throughout brain parenchyma. Both single cells and multiple cell clusters were observed as early as postnatal day 30 in all ENU-exposed brains examined (n = 11). Such distinctive nestin-expressing cells were not seen in nestin-stained control brains or ENU-exposed brains stained for GFAP or vimentin, nor was such a cell seen in a stab wound model used to assess reactive astrocytosis. While the number of these clusters was highly variable among rats, their size increased between 30 and 90 days. The data suggest that these nestin-expressing cells represent an early stage of the neoplastic process. It remains to be determined whether these cells become apparent at 30 days of age due to \"dedifferentiation\" of a local resident astrocyte or astrocyte precursor cell or migration of a relatively undifferentiated precursor/stem cell from the SVZ.',\n",
              "  'Bach1 regulates osteoclastogenesis in a mouse model via both heme oxygenase 1-dependent and heme oxygenase 1-independent pathways. OBJECTIVE: Reducing inflammation and osteoclastogenesis by heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) induction could be beneficial in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the function of HO-1 in bone metabolism remains unclear. This study was undertaken to clarify the effects of HO-1 and its repressor Bach1 in osteoclastogenesis. METHODS: In vitro osteoclastogenesis was compared in Bach1-deficient and wild-type mice. Osteoclasts (OCs) were generated from bone marrow-derived macrophages by stimulation with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL. Osteoclastogenesis was assessed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and expression of OC-related genes. Intracellular signal pathways in OC precursors were also assessed. HO-1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was transduced into Bach1(-/-) mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages to examine the role of HO-1 in osteoclastogenesis. In vivo inflammatory bone loss was evaluated by local injection of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) into calvaria. RESULTS: Transcription of HO-1 was down-regulated by stimulation with RANKL in the early stage of OC differentiation. Bach1(-/-) mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were partially resistant to the RANKL-dependent HO-1 reduction and showed impaired osteoclastogenesis, which was associated with reduced expression of RANK and components of the downstream TNF receptor-associated factor 6/c-Fos/NF-ATc1 pathway as well as reduced expression of Blimp1. Treatment with HO-1 shRNA increased the number of OCs and expression of OC-related genes except for the Blimp1 gene during in vitro osteoclastogenesis from Bach1(-/-) mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. TNFα-induced bone destruction was reduced in Bach1(-/-) mice in vivo. CONCLUSION: The present findings demonstrate that Bach1 regulates osteoclastogenesis under inflammatory conditions, via both HO-1-dependent and HO-1-independent mechanisms. Bach1 may be worthy of consideration as a target for treatment of inflammatory bone loss in diseases including RA.',\n",
              "  \"CDK5-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of Drp1 during neuronal maturation. Mitochondrial functions are essential for the survival and function of neurons. Recently, it has been demonstrated that mitochondrial functions are highly associated with mitochondrial morphology, which is dynamically changed by the balance between fusion and fission. Mitochondrial morphology is primarily controlled by the activation of dynamin-related proteins including dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which promotes mitochondrial fission. Drp1 activity is regulated by several post-translational modifications, thereby modifying mitochondrial morphology. Here, we found that phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine 616 (S616) is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in post-mitotic rat neurons. Perturbation of CDK5 activity modified the level of Drp1S616 phosphorylation and mitochondrial morphology in neurons. In addition, phosphorylated Drp1S616 preferentially localized as a cytosolic monomer compared with total Drp1. Furthermore, roscovitine, a chemical inhibitor of CDKs, increased oligomerization and mitochondrial translocation of Drp1, suggesting that CDK5-dependent phosphorylation of Drp1 serves to reduce Drp1's fission-promoting activity. Taken together, we propose that CDK5 has a significant role in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology via inhibitory phosphorylation of Drp1S616 in post-mitotic neurons.\",\n",
              "  'PPADS, a P2X receptor antagonist, as a novel inhibitor of the reverse mode of the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger in guinea pig airway smooth muscle. The Na(+)/Ca(2+)exchanger (NCX) principal function is taking 1 Ca(2+) out of the cytoplasm and introducing 3 Na(+). The increase of cytoplasmic Na(+) concentration induces the NCX reverse mode (NCX(REV)), favoring Ca(2+) influx. NCX(REV) can be inhibited by: KB-R7943 a non-specific compound that blocks voltage-dependent and store-operated Ca(2+) channels; SEA0400 that appears to be selective for NCX(REV), but difficult to obtain and SN-6, which efficacy has been shown only in cardiomyocytes. We found that PPADS, a P2X receptor antagonist, acts as a NCX(REV) inhibitor in guinea pig tracheal myocytes. In these cells, we characterized the NCX(REV) by substituting NaCl and NaHCO(3) with LiCl, resulting in the increase of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) using fura 2-AM. We analyzed 5 consecutive responses of the NCX(REV) every 10 min, finding no differences among them. To evaluate the effect of different NCX(REV) blockers, concentration response curves to KB-R7943 (1, 3.2 and 10 μM), and SN-6 (3.2, 10 and 30 μM) were constructed, whereas PPADS effect was characterized as time- and concentration-dependent (1, 3.2, 10 and 30 μM). PPADS had similar potency and efficacy as KB-R7943, whereas SN-6 was the least effective. Furthermore, KCl-induced contraction, sensitive to D600 and nifedipine, was blocked by KB-R7943, but not by PPADS. KCl-induced [Ca(2+)]i increment in myocytes was also significantly decreased by KBR-7943 (10 μM). Our results demonstrate that PPADS can be used as a reliable pharmacological tool to inhibit NCX(REV), with the advantage that it is more specific than KB-R7943 because it does not affect L-type Ca(2+) channels.',\n",
              "  'Dasatinib, a small-molecule protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation. Dasatinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK), including p56(Lck) (Lck). Given the central importance of Lck in transmitting signals from the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling complex and the potent ability of dasatinib to inhibit Lck activity, we hypothesized this agent could provide a novel route of immunomodulation via targeted inhibition of antigen-induced signaling. Herein, we show that dasatinib inhibits TCR-mediated signal transduction, cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and in vivo T-cell responses. However, dasatinib-mediated inhibition does not induce apoptosis because the effect is reversible or may be overcome by signals bypassing the TCR, such as phorbol ester. Signal transduction and proliferative responses via IL-2 remain essentially unperturbed, suggesting that dasatinib displays specificity for TCR signaling. In addition, dasatinib combined with cyclosporine A or rapamycin led to a much more potent inhibition of T-cell activation, suggesting that targeted inhibition of Lck could be a useful adjunct for enhanced immunomodulation. In combination with currently available immunomodulatory agents, SFK inhibition could potentially increase immunomodulatory efficacy while minimizing toxicity of individual agents.',\n",
              "  'TAp73 is downregulated in oocytes from women of advanced reproductive age. Studies on oocyte transcriptome are important to understand the biological pathways involved in oogenesis, totipotence and early embryonic development. Moreover, genes regulating physiological pathways in gametes could represent potential candidates for reproductive disorders. In addition to oocyte specific transcription factors, also the members of the p53 family could be etiologically involved due to their biological functions. In fact, their role in the control of cell cycle, apoptosis, and germ-line genome stability is well known. Female reproductive aging is one of the causes of fertility reduction and it is often associated with egg aneuploidy increase. In order to verify the potential involvement of p73 in reproductive aging, we determined its expression in single mature MII oocytes from two groups of women, younger than 35 or older than 38 years, respectively. We found that TAp73 isoforms are down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. We confirmed these data in pools of mouse oocytes. TAp73 down regulation in oocytes from women of advanced reproductive age could explain both the reduction of fertility and the increase of newborns with chromosomal abnormalities.',\n",
              "  \"The emerging role of p53 in exercise metabolism. The major tumour suppressor protein, p53, is one of the most well-studied proteins in cell biology. Often referred to as the Guardian of the Genome, the list of known functions of p53 include regulatory roles in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, angiogenesis, DNA repair and cell senescence. More recently, p53 has been implicated as a key molecular player regulating substrate metabolism and exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. In this context, the study of p53 therefore has obvious implications for both human health and performance, given that impaired mitochondrial content and function is associated with the pathology of many metabolic disorders such as ageing, type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer, as well as reduced exercise performance. Studies on p53 knockout (KO) mice collectively demonstrate that ablation of p53 content reduces intermyofibrillar (IMF) and subsarcolemmal (SS) mitochondrial yield, reduces cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-α protein content whilst also reducing mitochondrial respiration and increasing reactive oxygen species production during state 3 respiration in IMF mitochondria. Additionally, p53 KO mice exhibit marked reductions in exercise capacity (in the magnitude of 50 %) during fatiguing swimming, treadmill running and electrical stimulation protocols. p53 may regulate contractile-induced increases in mitochondrial content via modulating mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) content and/or activity, given that p53 KO mice display reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA, Tfam messenger RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, upon muscle contraction, p53 is phosphorylated on serine 15 and subsequently translocates to the mitochondria where it forms a complex with Tfam to modulate expression of mitochondrial-encoded subunits of the COX complex. In human skeletal muscle, the exercise-induced phosphorylation of p53(Ser15) is enhanced in conditions of reduced carbohydrate availability in association with enhanced upstream signalling through 5'adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In this way, undertaking regular exercise in carbohydrate restricted states may therefore be a practical approach to achieve the physiological benefits of consistent p53 signalling. Although our knowledge of p53 in exercise metabolism has advanced considerably, much of our current understanding of p53 regulation and associated targets is derived from various non-muscle cells and tissues. As such, many fundamental questions remain unanswered in contracting skeletal muscle. Detailed studies concerning the time-course of p53 activation (including additional post-translational modifications and subsequent subcellular translocation), as well as the effects of exercise modality (endurance versus resistance), intensity, duration, fibre type, age, training status and nutrient availability, must now be performed so that we can optimise exercise prescription guidelines to strategically target p53 signalling. The emerging role of p53 in skeletal muscle metabolism therefore represents a novel and exciting research area for exercise and muscle physiologists.\",\n",

The functional significance and regulation of NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox) isoforms by angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was studied. Expression of Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 (gene and protein) and NAD(P)H oxidase activity were increased in SHR. Basal NAD(P)H oxidase activity was blocked by GKT136901 (Nox1/4 inhibitor) and by Nox1 siRNA in WKY cells and by siNOX1 and siNOX2 in SHR. Whereas Ang II increased expression of all Noxes in WKY, only Nox1 was influenced in SHR. Ang II-induced NAD(P)H activity was inhibited by siNOX1 in WKY and by siNOX1 and siNOX2 in SHR. ET-1 upregulated Nox expression only in WKY and increased NAD(P)H oxidase activity, an effect inhibited by siNOX1 and siNOX2. Nox1 co-localized with Nox2 but not with Nox4, implicating association between Nox1 and Nox2 but not between Nox1 and Nox4. These data highlight the complexity of Nox biology in VSMCs, emphasising that more than one Nox member, alone or in association, may be involved in NAD(P)H oxidase-mediated •O(2)(-) production. Nox1 regulation by Ang II, but not by ET-1, may be important in •O(2)(-) formation in VSMCs from SHR.',\n",

The efficacy and safety of flumazenil were assessed in comparison to placebo in a double-blind randomised study of 31 adults intoxicated with benzodiazepines. The criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation, and orientation in time and space. Patients who received flumazenil awoke within minutes but central depression returned partly one hour later, which reflects the short elimination half-life of the drug. Side effects were few and the results indicate that flumazenil is effective in the primary management of benzodiazepine overdose and in states where benzodiazepines have been taken with other drugs.',\n",
              "  'Calcineurin signaling and NFAT activation in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development. Calcineurin signaling has been implicated in a broad spectrum of developmental processes in a variety of organ systems. Calcineurin is a calmodulin-dependent, calcium-activated protein phosphatase composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The serine/threonine-specific phosphatase functions within a signal transduction pathway that regulates gene expression and biological responses in many developmentally important cell types. Calcineurin signaling was first defined in T lymphocytes as a regulator of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor nuclear translocation and activation. Recent studies have demonstrated the vital nature of calcium/calcineurin/NFAT signaling in cardiovascular and skeletal muscle development in vertebrates. Inhibition, mutation, or forced expression of calcineurin pathway genes result in defects or alterations in cardiomyocyte maturation, heart valve formation, vascular development, skeletal muscle differentiation and fiber-type switching, and cardiac and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Conserved calcineurin genes are found in invertebrates such as Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, and genetic studies have demonstrated specific myogenic functions for the phosphatase in their development. The ability to investigate calcineurin signaling pathways in vertebrates and model genetic organisms provides a great potential to more fully comprehend the functions of calcineurin and its interacting genes in heart, blood vessel, and muscle development.',\n",
              "  'XOMA 052, a potent, high-affinity monoclonal antibody for the treatment of IL-1β-mediated diseases. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a potent mediator of inflammatory responses and plays a role in the differentiation of a number of lymphoid cells. In several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, serum levels of IL-1β are elevated and correlate with disease development and severity. The central role of the IL-1 pathway in several diseases has been validated by inhibitors currently in clinical development or approved by the FDA. However, the need to effectively modulate IL-1β-mediated local inflammation with the systemic delivery of an efficacious, safe and convenient drug still exists. To meet these challenges, we developed XOMA 052 (gevokizumab), a potent anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibody that was designed in silico and humanized using Human Engineering™ technology. XOMA 052 has a 300 femtomolar binding affinity for human IL-1β and an in vitro potency in the low picomolar range. XOMA 052 binds to a unique IL-1β epitope where residues critical for binding have been identified. We have previously reported that XOMA 052 is efficacious in vivo in a diet-induced obesity mouse model thought to be driven by low levels of chronic inflammation. We report here that XOMA 052 also reduces acute inflammation in vivo, neutralizing the effect of exogenously administered human IL-1β and blocking peritonitis in a mouse model of acute gout. Based on its high potency, novel mechanism of action, long half-life, and high affinity, XOMA 052 provides a new strategy for the treatment of a number of inflammatory, autoimmune and metabolic diseases in which the role of IL-1β is central to pathogenesis.',\n",

The objective was to determine the composition of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Population attending specialist UK CF centres in terms of age, gender, age at diagnosis, genotype and ethnicity. With the planned introduction of the national CF screening programme in the UK, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutations were compared between different ethnic groups enabling a UK-specific frequency of mutations to be defined. Data were analysed from the patient biographies held in the UK CF Database (see www.cystic-fibrosis.org.uk). The currently registered population of 5,274 CF patients is 96.3% Caucasian with a male preponderance that significantly increases with age. The majority of the 196 non-Caucasian CF patients are from the Indian Subcontinent (ISC), of which one in 84 UK CF patients are of Pakistani origin. The commonest CFTR mutation, deltaF508, is found in 74.1% of all CF chromosomes. In the Caucasian CF population, 57.5% are deltaF508 homozygotes but the UK ISC CF population with only 24.7%, has significantly fewer deltaF508 homozygotes patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.4). The distribution of Caucasian patients with deltaF508/deltaF508, deltaF508/Other and Other/Other does not fit the expected distribution with a Hardy-Weinberg model unless those patients without a detected mutation are excluded (P<0.001). The UK CF Database has shown the UK CF population to have distinct characteristics separate from the North American and European CF Registries. The ISC group contains many mutations not recognised by current genetic analysis, and one in four ISC patients have no CFTR mutations identified. The CFTR analysis proposed for the screening programme would detect 96% of patients registered in the database, but is unlikely to achieve the desired >80% detection rates in the ethnic minority groups. Screen-positive, non-Caucasian infants without an identifiable CFTR mutation should be referred for a sweat test and genetic counselling when serum trypsinogen concentrations remain elevated after birth.',\n",
              "  'The S-methylmethionine cycle in angiosperms: ubiquity, antiquity and activity. Angiosperms synthesize S-methylmethionine (SMM) from methionine (Met) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in a unique reaction catalyzed by Met S-methyltransferase (MMT). SMM serves as methyl donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine, catalyzed by homocysteine S-methyltransferase (HMT). MMT and HMT together have been proposed to constitute a futile SMM cycle that stops the free Met pool from being depleted by an overshoot in AdoMet synthesis. Arabidopsis and maize have one MMT gene, and at least three HMT genes that belong to two anciently diverged classes and encode enzymes with distinct properties and expression patterns. SMM, and presumably its cycle, must therefore have originated before dicot and monocot lineages separated. Arabidopsis leaves, roots and developing seeds all express MMT and HMTs, and can metabolize [35S]Met to [35S]SMM and vice versa. The SMM cycle therefore operates throughout the plant. This appears to be a general feature of angiosperms, as digital gene expression profiles show that MMT and HMT are co-expressed in leaves, roots and reproductive tissues of maize and other species. An in silico model of the SMM cycle in mature Arabidopsis leaves was developed from radiotracer kinetic measurements and pool size data. This model indicates that the SMM cycle consumes half the AdoMet produced, and suggests that the cycle serves to stop accumulation of AdoMet, rather than to prevent depletion of free Met. Because plants lack the negative feedback loops that regulate AdoMet pool size in other eukaryotes, the SMM cycle may be the main mechanism whereby plants achieve short-term control of AdoMet level.',\n",
              "  'Anti-ischemic effect of a novel cardioprotective agent, JTV519, is mediated through specific activation of delta-isoform of protein kinase C in rat ventricular myocardium. BACKGROUND: A new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV519, has a strong protective effect against Ca(2+) overload-induced myocardial injury. We investigated the effect of JTV519 on ischemia/reperfusion injury in isolated rat hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: At 30 minutes of reperfusion after 30-minute global ischemia, the percent recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was improved, and the creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase leakage was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner when JTV519 was administered in the coronary perfusate both at 5 minutes before the induction of ischemia and at the time of reperfusion. The myocardial protective effect of JTV519 was completely blocked by pretreatment of the heart with GF109203X, a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. In contrast, the effect of JTV519 was not affected by alpha(1)-, A(1)-, and B(2)-receptor blockers that couple with PKC in the cardiomyocyte. Both immunofluorescence images and immunoblots of JTV519-treated left ventricular myocardium and isolated ventricular myocytes demonstrated that this agent induced concentration-dependent translocation of the delta-isoform but not the other isoforms of PKC to the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of cardioprotection by JTV519 against ischemia/reperfusion injury involves isozyme-specific PKC activation through a receptor-independent mechanism. This agent may provide a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of patients with acute coronary diseases via a subcellular mechanism mimicking ischemic preconditioning.',\n",
              "  'K201 (JTV519) suppresses spontaneous Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2 irrespective of FKBP12.6 association. K201 (JTV519), a benzothiazepine derivative, has been shown to possess anti-arrhythmic and cardioprotective properties, but the mechanism of its action is both complex and controversial. It is believed to stabilize the closed state of the RyR2 (cardiac ryanodine receptor) by increasing its affinity for the FKBP12.6 (12.6 kDa FK506 binding protein) [Wehrens, Lehnart, Reiken, Deng, Vest, Cervantes, Coromilas, Landry and Marks (2004) Science 304, 292-296]. In the present study, we investigated the effect of K201 on spontaneous Ca2+ release induced by Ca2+ overload in rat ventricular myocytes and in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) expressing RyR2 and the role of FKBP12.6 in the action of K201. We found that K201 abolished spontaneous Ca2+ release in cardiac myocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Treating ventricular myocytes with FK506 to dissociate FKBP12.6 from RyR2 did not affect the suppression of spontaneous Ca2+ release by K201. Similarly, K201 was able to suppress spontaneous Ca2+ release in FK506-treated HEK-293 cells co-expressing RyR2 and FKBP12.6. Furthermore, K201 suppressed spontaneous Ca2+ release in HEK-293 cells expressing RyR2 alone and in cells co-expressing RyR2 and FKBP12.6 with the same potency. In addition, K201 inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2-wt (wild-type) and an RyR2 mutant linked to ventricular tachycardia and sudden death, N4104K, in the absence of FKBP12.6. These observations demonstrate that FKBP12.6 is not involved in the inhibitory action of K201 on spontaneous Ca2+ release. Our results also suggest that suppression of spontaneous Ca2+ release and the activity of RyR2 contributes, at least in part, to the anti-arrhythmic properties of K201.',\n",
              "  \"Light-induced isomerization of the LHCII-bound xanthophyll neoxanthin: possible implications for photoprotection in plants. Light-harvesting pigment-protein complex of Photosystem II (LHCII) is the largest photosynthetic antenna complex of plants and the most abundant membrane protein in the biosphere. Plant fitness and productivity depend directly on a balance between excitations in the photosynthetic apparatus, generated by captured light quanta, and the rate of photochemical processes. Excess excitation energy leads to oxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus and entire organism and therefore the balance between the excitation density and photosynthesis requires precise and efficient regulation, operating also at the level of antenna complexes. We show that illumination of the isolated LHCII leads to isomerization of the protein-bound neoxanthin from conformation 9'-cis to 9',13- and 9',13'-dicis forms. At the same time light-driven excitation quenching is observed, manifested by a decrease in chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity and shortened fluorescence lifetimes. Both processes, the neoxanthin isomerization and the chlorophyll excitation quenching, are reversible in dim light. The results of the 77K florescence measurements of LHCII show that illumination is associated with appearance of the low-energy states, which can serve as energy traps in the pigment-protein complex subjected to excess excitation. Possible sequence of the molecular events is proposed, leading to a protective excess excitation energy quenching: neoxanthin photo-isomerization→formation of LHCII supramolecular structures which potentiate creation of energy traps→excitation quenching.\",\n",
              "  'The cardioprotective effects of a new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV519, on ischemia/reperfusion-induced Ca2+ overload in isolated rat hearts. A new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV519 (JTV), has strong protective effects against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury. We investigated the effects of JTV on Ca2+ overload and on functional recovery during ischemia/reperfusion in isolated coronary-perfused rat hearts. After 30 minutes of reperfusion following 30 min of global ischemia, the % recovery of LV developed pressure was improved in a concentration-dependent manner when JTV (0.3-3.0 microM) was administered either 5 min before induction of ischemia or for 5 min at the time of reperfusion only JTV showed a negative inotropic effect only at concentrations above 3.0 microM. In indol-loaded isolated heart preparations, 0.3 microM JTV did not affect the preischemic systolic or diastolic Ca2+ levels of the Ca2+ transient as measured by the ratio of 2-wavelength fluormetry (R405/500). In contrast, it significantly reduced the increase in the ratio in the postischemic reperfusion period (% change of R405/500 from baseline: JTV(-), by 42.7 +/- 3.2%; JTV(+), by 18.4 +/- 9.1%, p < 0.05). In isolated rat ventricular myocytes with a standard patch-clamp method, we further tested the interaction of JTV with the L-type Ca2+ channel (I(Ca)). The % inhibition of the peak current of I(Ca) was 6.2 +/- 0.8% at 0.3 microM (p = n.s.), 22.0 +/- 3.3% at 1.0 microM (p < 0.05), and 59.6 +/- 1.4% at 3.0 microM (p < 0.01). Thus, the marked cardioprotection due to JTV at 0.3 microM may not be solely attributed to its inhibitory effect on the transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx through I(Ca). In conclusion, JTV519 is a novel pharmacological agent that has been demonstrated for the first time to have clinical potential for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome by its efficacy in administration at the time of reperfusion, by its suppression of reperfusion-related intracellular Ca2+ overload with no significant interaction with I(Ca), and by its subsequent ability of strong myocardial protection.',\n",
              "  'Dietary lipids and aging compromise chaperone-mediated autophagy by similar mechanisms. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective form of autophagy whose distinctive feature is the fact that substrate proteins are translocated directly from the cytosol across the lysosomal membrane for degradation inside lysosomes. CMA substrates are cytosolic proteins bearing a pentapeptide motif in their sequence that, when recognized by the cytosolic chaperone HSPA8/HSC70, targets them to the surface of the lysosomes. Once there, substrate proteins bind to the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2 isoform A (LAMP2A), inducing assembly of this receptor protein into a higher molecular weight protein complex that is used by the substrate proteins to reach the lysosomal lumen. CMA is constitutively active in most cells but it is maximally activated under conditions of stress.',\n",
              "  'Betrixaban compared with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: results of a phase 2, randomized, dose-ranging study (Explore-Xa). AIMS: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at increased risk of stroke. Betrixaban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor administered once daily, mostly excreted unchanged in the bile and with low (17%) renal excretion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with AF and more than one risk factor for stroke were randomized to one of three blinded doses of betrixaban (40, 60, or 80 mg once daily) or unblinded warfarin, adjusted to an international normalized ratio of 2.0-3.0. The primary outcome was major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. The mean follow-up was 147 days. Among 508 patients randomized, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.2; 87% of patients had previously received vitamin K antagonist therapy. The time in therapeutic range on warfarin was 63.4%. There were one, five, five, and seven patients with a primary outcome on betrixaban 40, 60, 80 mg daily, or warfarin, respectively. The rate of the primary outcome was lowest on betrixaban 40 mg (hazard ratio compared with warfarin = 0.14, exact stratified log-rank P-value 0.04, unadjusted for multiple testing). Rates of the primary outcome with betrixaban 60 or 80 mg were more similar to those of wafarin. Two ischaemic strokes occurred, one each on betrixaban 60 and 80 mg daily. There were two vascular deaths, one each on betrixaban 40 mg and warfarin. Betrixaban was associated with higher rates of diarrhoea than warfarin. CONCLUSION: Betrixaban was well tolerated and had similar or lower rates of bleeding compared with well-controlled warfarin in patients with AF at risk for stroke.',\n",
              "  \"Eliglustat compared with imiglucerase in patients with Gaucher's disease type 1 stabilised on enzyme replacement therapy: a phase 3, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial. BACKGROUND: The mainstay of treatment for Gaucher's disease type 1 is alternate-week infusion of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We investigated whether patients stable on such treatment would remain so after switching to oral eliglustat, a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomised, multinational, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled adults (aged > 18 years) who had received ERT for 3 years or more for Gaucher's disease. Patients were randomly allocated 2:1 at 39 clinics (stratified by ERT dose; block sizes of four; computer-generated centrally) to receive either oral eliglustat or imiglucerase infusions for 12 months. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment assignment, but the central reader who assessed organ volumes was masked. The composite primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of patients whose haematological variables and organ volumes remained stable for 12 months (ie, haemoglobin decrease not more than 15 g/L, platelet count decrease not more than 25%, spleen volume increase not more than 25%, and liver volume increase not more than 20%, in multiples of normal from baseline). The non-inferiority margin was 25% for eliglustat relative to imiglucerase, assessed in all patients who completed 12 months of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00943111, and EudraCT, number 2008-005223-28. FINDINGS: Between Sept 15, 2009, and Nov 9, 2011, we randomly allocated 106 (66%) patients to eliglustat and 54 (34%) to imiglucerase. In the per-protocol population, 84 (85%) of 99 patients who completed eliglustat treatment and 44 (94%) of 47 patients who completed imiglucerase treatment met the composite primary endpoint (between-group difference -8·8%; 95% CI -17·6 to 4·2). The lower bound of the 95% CI of -17·6% was within the prespecified threshold for non-inferiority. Dropouts occurred due to palpitations (one patient on eliglustat), myocardial infarction (one patient on eliglustat), and psychotic disorder (one patient on imiglucerase). No deaths occurred. 97 (92%) of 106 patients in the eliglustat group had treatment-emergent adverse events, as did 42 (79%) of 53 in the imiglucerase group (mostly mild or moderate in severity). INTERPRETATION: Oral eliglustat maintained haematological and organ volume stability in adults with Gaucher's disease type 1 already controlled by intravenous ERT and could be a useful therapeutic option.

              "  'Evidence of nestin-positive cells in the human cutaneus Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles. Nestin is an intermediate filament protein expressed in neuroepithelial stem cells during development and it is later replaced by cell specific neuronal or glial filaments. Nevertheless, nestin⁺ cells remain within adult tissues and they can be regarded as potential neural stem cell (NSC). Nestin⁺ cells have been detected in Schwann cells related with sensory corpuscles of rodent and they have been demonstrated to be NSC. We have investigated the existence of nestin⁺ in human cutaneous cells Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles through the use of immunohistochemistry techniques and in situ hybridization. S100 protein (also regarded as a marker for NSC) and vimentin (the intermediate filament of mature Schwann cells in sensory corpuscles) were also investigated. The results show that the adult human cutaneous sensory Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles contains a small population of Schwann-related cells (vimentin⁺) which on the basis of their basic immunohistochemical characteristics (S100 protein⁺, nestin⁺) can be potential NSCs. Cells sharing identical immunohistochemical profile were also found in the close vicinity of Meissner corpuscles. Because their localization they are easily accessible and may represent a peripheral niche of NSC to be used for therapeutic goals.',\n",

The transcriptional silencing of one of the female X-chromosomes is a finely regulated process that requires accumulation in cis of the long non-coding RNA X-inactive-specific transcript (Xist) followed by a series of epigenetic modifications. Little is known about the molecular machinery regulating initiation and maintenance of chromosomal silencing. Here, we introduce a new version of our algorithm catRAPID to investigate Xist associations with a number of proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, nuclear scaffolding, transcription and splicing processes. Our method correctly identifies binding regions and affinities of protein interactions, providing a powerful theoretical framework for the study of X-chromosome inactivation and other events mediated by ribonucleoprotein associations.',\n",
              "  'GBshape: a genome browser database for DNA shape annotations. Many regulatory mechanisms require a high degree of specificity in protein-DNA binding. Nucleotide sequence does not provide an answer to the question of why a protein binds only to a small subset of the many putative binding sites in the genome that share the same core motif. Whereas higher-order effects, such as chromatin accessibility, cooperativity and cofactors, have been described, DNA shape recently gained attention as another feature that fine-tunes the DNA binding specificities of some transcription factor families. Our Genome Browser for DNA shape annotations (GBshape; freely available at http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/) provides minor groove width, propeller twist, roll, helix twist and hydroxyl radical cleavage predictions for the entire genomes of 94 organisms. Additional genomes can easily be added using the GBshape framework. GBshape can be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative values of DNA shape features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide resolution. As biological applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNA shape features that are present in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fly and worm, and we demonstrate structural similarities between transcription start sites in the genomes of four Drosophila species.',\n",
              "  'McLeod phenotype without the McLeod syndrome. BACKGROUND: McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is a late-onset X-linked multisystem disorder affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems, red blood cells (RBCs), and internal organs. A variety of mutations have been found in the responsible gene (XK) including single nonsense and missense mutations, nucleotide mutations at or near the splice junctions of introns of XK, and different deletion mutations. To date no clear phenotype-genotype correlation is apparent. The clinical details of one case of McLeod phenotype without apparent neuromuscular abnormalities have been reported. Here the clinical details of two additional cases are presented, of which the genetic details have previously been published. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases at ages expected to manifest the McLeod syndrome (MLS) were evaluated. The first case had been authenticated as a genuine McLeod both by serology and by genotyping (R222G missense mutation) and the second case had a mutation in XK (IVS2+5G>A) and by serology exhibited very weak Kx antigen and no detectable Kell antigens, except extremely low k antigen by adsorption-elution technique. The patients were examined for hematologic, neurologic, and other clinical abnormalities. RESULTS: Despite documented McLeod phenotype on RBCs, and identified mutations of XK, neurologic and other clinical findings were minimal at ages expected to manifest MLS. CONCLUSIONS: The different XK mutations may have different effects upon the XK gene product and thus may account for the variable phenotype.',\n",

This column is the first in a two-part series exploring lessons for psychiatric drug development that can be learned from the development of six central nervous system drugs with novel mechanisms of action over the past 25 years. Part 1 presents a brief overview of the neuroscience that supported the development of each drug, including the rationale for selecting a) the target, which in each case was a receptor for a specific neurotransmitter system, and b) the indication, which was based on an understanding of the role that target played in a specific neural circuit in the brain. The neurotransmitter systems on which the development of these agents were based included serotonin for ondansetron and lorcaserin, dopamine for varenicline, substance P (or neurokinin) for aprepitant, melatonin for ramelteon, and orexin for suvorexant. The indications were chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting for ondansetron and aprepitant, smoking cessation for varenicline, weight loss for lorcaserin, and insomnia for suvorexant and ramelteon.',\n",
              "  'Stress Responses in Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.): I. Induction of Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis and Hydrolytic Enzymes in Elicitor-Treated Cell Suspension Cultures. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cell suspension cultures accumulated high concentrations of the pterocarpan phytoalexin medicarpin, reaching a maximum within 24 hours after exposure to an elicitor preparation from cell walls of the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. This was preceded by increases in the extractable activities of the isoflavonoid biosynthetic enzymes l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase, 4-coumarate coenzyme A-ligase, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and isoflavone O-methyltransferase. Pectic polysaccharides were weak elicitors of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity but did not induce medicarpin accumulation, whereas reduced glutathione was totally inactive as an elicitor in this system. The fungal cell wall extract was a weak elicitor of the lignin biosynthetic enzymes, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase and coniferyl alcohol dehydrogenase, but did not induce appreciable increases in the activities of the hydrolytic enzymes chitinase and 1,3-beta-d-glucanase. The results are discussed in relation to the activation of isoflavonoid biosynthesis in other legumes and the development of the alfalfa cell culture system as a model for studying the enzymology and molecular biology of plant defense expression.',\n",
              "  'TSH regulates pendrin membrane abundance and enhances iodide efflux in thyroid cells. Thyroid hormones are essential for normal development and metabolism. Their synthesis requires transport of iodide into thyroid follicles. The mechanisms involving the apical efflux of iodide into the follicular lumen are poorly elucidated. The discovery of mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in patients with Pendred syndrome (congenital deafness, goiter, and defective iodide organification) suggested a possible role for the encoded protein, pendrin, as an apical iodide transporter. We determined whether TSH regulates pendrin abundance at the plasma membrane and whether this influences iodide efflux. Results of immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiments reveal that TSH and forskolin rapidly increase pendrin abundance at the plasma membrane through the protein kinase A pathway in PCCL-3 rat thyroid cells. The increase in pendrin membrane abundance correlates with a decrease in intracellular iodide as determined by measuring intracellular (125)iodide and can be inhibited by specific blocking of pendrin. Elimination of the putative protein kinase A phosphorylation site T717A results in a diminished translocation to the membrane in response to forskolin. These results demonstrate that pendrin translocates to the membrane in response to TSH and suggest that it may have a physiological role in apical iodide transport and thyroid hormone synthesis.',\n",
              "  \"Cognition-induced modulation of serotonin in the orbitofrontal cortex: a controlled cross-over PET study of a delayed match-to-sample task using the 5-HT2a receptor antagonist [18F]altanserin. Behavioral and cellular studies indicate that serotonin interacting with the 5-HT2a receptor (5-HT2aR) is involved in cognitive processes supporting working memory (WM). However, 5-HT receptor neuroimaging studies directly relating WM-induced neuronal activations to concomitant changes in the availability of 5-HT receptors as a functional measure for serotonin release are lacking. This controlled cross-over PET study aimed to identify brain regions with WM-induced changes in the binding potential (BP(nd)) of the 5-HT2aR antagonist [(18)F]altanserin. Ten young males underwent a delayed match-to-sample task using photographs of faces and a control task. The BP(nd)s for both conditions were calculated by applying Ichise's noninvasive plot. Statistics were performed with the SPM toolbox statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM3) particularly suited for analyzing whole-brain PET data in an exploratory way. A higher BP(nd) for [(18)F]altanserin during WM versus control was found in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) pointing towards an increased [(18)F]altanserin/5-HT2aR interaction in OFC while BP(nd) decreases during WM were not found. Furthermore, no BP(nd) changes in regions known from functional neuroimaging studies to be more specifically involved in WM were identified. These findings may suggest that the increased [(18)F]altanserin BP(nd) under WM challenge and hence the increased availability of 5-HT2aR reflects a decrease in local OFC serotonin. As the OFC plays a prominent role in decision-making and supports cognitive processes related to the central executive functions of WM it might be modulated by the serotoninergic system via the 5-HT2aR in order to support and optimize basic cognitive functions.\",\n",

Heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) used commonly are the standard treatment of venous and arterial thromboses. They are very efficient and safe, but have some limitations: iatrogenicity, laboratory monitoring, parenteral use for heparins and fondaparinux. Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The objective is to substitute these indirect inhibitors of factor Xa (heparins, low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux) in the prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic episodes. The new direct inhibitors do not require routine laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation. They inhibit the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are efficacious and safe in the prevention of cerebral infarcts in patients with non-valvular fibrillation. Apixaban is another direct inhibitor of factor Xa used orally which is developed in the same indications as rivaroxaban. Edoxaban and betrixaban are also in development. The objective of this work is to study the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, the efficacy and safety of these four oral direct factor Xa inhibitors.',\n",

The objective was to determine the composition of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Population attending specialist UK CF centres in terms of age, gender, age at diagnosis, genotype and ethnicity. With the planned introduction of the national CF screening programme in the UK, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutations were compared between different ethnic groups enabling a UK-specific frequency of mutations to be defined. Data were analysed from the patient biographies held in the UK CF Database (see www.cystic-fibrosis.org.uk). The currently registered population of 5,274 CF patients is 96.3% Caucasian with a male preponderance that significantly increases with age. The majority of the 196 non-Caucasian CF patients are from the Indian Subcontinent (ISC), of which one in 84 UK CF patients are of Pakistani origin. The commonest CFTR mutation, deltaF508, is found in 74.1% of all CF chromosomes. In the Caucasian CF population, 57.5% are deltaF508 homozygotes but the UK ISC CF population with only 24.7%, has significantly fewer deltaF508 homozygotes patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.4). The distribution of Caucasian patients with deltaF508/deltaF508, deltaF508/Other and Other/Other does not fit the expected distribution with a Hardy-Weinberg model unless those patients without a detected mutation are excluded (P<0.001). The UK CF Database has shown the UK CF population to have distinct characteristics separate from the North American and European CF Registries. The ISC group contains many mutations not recognised by current genetic analysis, and one in four ISC patients have no CFTR mutations identified. The CFTR analysis proposed for the screening programme would detect 96% of patients registered in the database, but is unlikely to achieve the desired >80% detection rates in the ethnic minority groups. Screen-positive, non-Caucasian infants without an identifiable CFTR mutation should be referred for a sweat test and genetic counselling when serum trypsinogen concentrations remain elevated after birth.',\n",

              "  'The epoxyketone-based proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and orally bioavailable oprozomib have anti-resorptive and bone-anabolic activity in addition to anti-myeloma effects. Proteasome inhibitors (PIs), namely bortezomib, have become a cornerstone therapy for multiple myeloma (MM), potently reducing tumor burden and inhibiting pathologic bone destruction. In clinical trials, carfilzomib, a next generation epoxyketone-based irreversible PI, has exhibited potent anti-myeloma efficacy and decreased side effects compared with bortezomib. Carfilzomib and its orally bioavailable analog oprozomib, effectively decreased MM cell viability following continual or transient treatment mimicking in vivo pharmacokinetics. Interactions between myeloma cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment augment the number and activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs) while inhibiting bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs), resulting in increased tumor growth and osteolytic lesions. At clinically relevant concentrations, carfilzomib and oprozomib directly inhibited OC formation and bone resorption in vitro, while enhancing osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization. Accordingly, carfilzomib and oprozomib increased trabecular bone volume, decreased bone resorption and enhanced bone formation in non-tumor bearing mice. Finally, in mouse models of disseminated MM, the epoxyketone-based PIs decreased murine 5TGM1 and human RPMI-8226 tumor burden and prevented bone loss. These data demonstrate that, in addition to anti-myeloma properties, carfilzomib and oprozomib effectively shift the bone microenvironment from a catabolic to an anabolic state and, similar to bortezomib, may decrease skeletal complications of MM.',\n",

We report a novel method for the chromatographic separation and measurement of stable carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) of individual amino acids in hair proteins and bone collagen using the LC-IsoLink system, which interfaces liquid chromatography (LC) with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). This paper provides baseline separation of 15 and 13 of the 18 amino acids in bone collagen and hair proteins, respectively. We also describe an approach to analysing small hair samples for compound-specific analysis of segmental hair sections. The LC/IRMS method is applied in a historical context by the delta(13)C analysis of hair proteins and bone collagen recovered from six individuals from Uummannaq in Greenland. The analysis of hair and bone amino acids from the same individual, compared for the first time in this study, is of importance in palaeodietary reconstruction. If hair proteins can be used as a proxy for bone collagen at the amino acid level, this validates compound-specific isotope studies using hair as a model for palaeodietary reconstruction. Our results suggest that a small offset observed in the bulk delta(13)C values of the hair and bone samples may be attributed to two factors: (i) amino acid compositional differences between hair and bone proteins, and (ii) differential turnover rates of the tissues and the amino acid pools contributing to their synthesis. This application proposes that hair may be a useful complementary or alternative source of compound-specific paleodietary information.',\n",
              "  'Focal cortical dysplasia - review. Focal cortical dysplasia is a malformation of cortical development, which is the most common cause of medically refractory epilepsy in the pediatric population and the second/third most common etiology of medically intractable seizures in adults.Both genetic and acquired factors are involved in the pathogenesis of cortical dysplasia. Numerous classifications of the complex structural abnormalities of focal cortical dysplasia have been proposed - from Taylor et al. in 1971 to the last modification of Palmini classification made by Blumcke in 2011. In general, three types of cortical dysplasia are recognized.Type I focal cortical dysplasia with mild symptomatic expression and late onset, is more often seen in adults, with changes present in the temporal lobe.Clinical symptoms are more severe in type II of cortical dysplasia usually seen in children. In this type, more extensive changes occur outside the temporal lobe with predilection for the frontal lobes.New type III is one of the above dysplasias with associated another principal lesion as hippocampal sclerosis, tumor, vascular malformation or acquired pathology during early life.Brain MRI imaging shows abnormalities in the majority of type II dysplasias and in only some of type I cortical dysplasias.THE MOST COMMON FINDINGS ON MRI IMAGING INCLUDE: focal cortical thickening or thinning, areas of focal brain atrophy, blurring of the gray-white junction, increased signal on T2- and FLAIR-weighted images in the gray and subcortical white matter often tapering toward the ventricle. On the basis of the MRI findings, it is possible to differentiate between type I and type II cortical dysplasia. A complete resection of the epileptogenic zone is required for seizure-free life. MRI imaging is very helpful to identify those patients who are likely to benefit from surgical treatment in a group of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.However, in type I cortical dysplasia, MR imaging is often normal, and also in both types the lesion seen on MRI may be smaller than the seizure-generating region seen in the EEG. The abnormalities may also involve vital for life brain parts, where curative surgery will not be an option. Therefore, other diagnostic imaging techniques such as FDG PET, MEG, DTI and intra-cranial EEG are widely used to establish the diagnosis and to decide on management.With advances in both genetics and neuroimaging, we may develop a better understanding of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, which will help us to provide more successful pharmacological and/or surgical treatment in the future.',\n",
              "  'Use of flumazenil in intoxicated patients with coma. A double-blind placebo-controlled study in ICU. In a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective clinical trial we studied the efficacy and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. In 23 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). In the remaining 7 patients, needing two series of injections of flumazenil (up to 2.0 mg), GCS did not rise significantly and coma was related to intoxications with nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, flunitrazepam and in one patient, encephalitis. In the 10 patients receiving placebo, the GCS did not change. A significant increase in the GCS from 5.5 to 10.8 (p less than 0.001) was, however, observed when flumazenil (up to 1.0 mg) was given after placebo. In patients with EEG monitoring the changes in waveform pattern paralleled the clinical response. Effects could be detected within 1-2 min after flumazenil injection and lasted up to 45 min. There were no adverse reactions or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. The use of flumazenil is of diagnostic value in mixed-drug intoxications or coma of unknown origin and is of therapeutic importance for reversal of benzodiazepine intoxications.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of abnormalities of thyroid function and morphology in a cohort of patients with Williams syndrome (WS). METHODS: Serum concentrations of free-T3, free-T4, TSH, thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOA) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgA), as well as ultrasonographic data, of 20 patients with WS (12 females and eight males), aged 1.7-34.9 years, were evaluated. RESULTS: Three cases (15%) of subclinical hypothyroidism were identified. Overt hypothyroidism was diagnosed in two cases (10%). Thyroid antibodies were negative in all patients. Fourteen patients (70%) showed thyroid hypoplasia involving the entire gland. In these patients, the left thyroid lobe appeared usually, but not significantly, reduced compared with the right thyroid lobe. One patient (5%) showed thyroid hemiagenesis. Only five patients (25%) showed a thyroid with normal volume, and of these five, one patient showed marked thyroid hypoplasia of the left lobe. In all WS patients with diagnosis of subclinical or overt hypothyroidism, thyroid hypoplasia was detected. No cases of subclinical or overt hypothyroidism were found in WS with normal thyroid volume. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the presence of alterations of thyroid function in WS and also suggests the frequent occurrence of abnormalities of thyroid morphology in these patients. Patients with WS should be monitored for thyroid function and a thyroid ultrasound screening should be considered, especially in those patients with changes in thyroid function.',\n",

CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM), represents a promising target for mAb-based immunotherapy. In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope. Daratumumab induced potent Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in CD38-expressing lymphoma- and MM-derived cell lines as well as in patient MM cells, both with autologous and allogeneic effector cells. Daratumumab stood out from other CD38 mAbs in its strong ability to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity in patient MM cells. Importantly, daratumumab-induced Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity were not affected by the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, indicating that daratumumab can effectively kill MM tumor cells in a tumor-preserving bone marrow microenvironment. In vivo, daratumumab was highly active and interrupted xenograft tumor growth at low dosing. Collectively, our results show the versatility of daratumumab to effectively kill CD38-expressing tumor cells, including patient MM cells, via diverse cytotoxic mechanisms. These findings support clinical development of daratumumab for the treatment of CD38-positive MM tumors.',\n",
              "  '[Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against multiple myeloma]. Multiple myeloma (MM) remains mostly incurable despite the recent progress in the treatment strategy. One of novel fields for anti-MM therapeutic strategy is the development of immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against myeloma-specific antigens. This article focuses on the basic and clinical aspects of several emerging and promising novel MoAbs for MM, such as elotuzumab which targets CS1 and daratumumab which targets CD38. Both antigens are highly expressed in more than 90% of MM patients, and the clinical trials have shown promising anti-MM effects, especially in combination with immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide. We also discuss the characteristics and the results of clinical trials of other MoAbs, such as tabalumab against B cell activating factor or dacetuzumab against CD40, being developed for MM.',\n",
              "  'Multiple origins of replication in archaea. Until recently, the only archaeon for which a bona fide origin of replication was reported was Pyrococcus abyssi, where a single origin was identified. Although several in silico analyses have suggested that some archaeal species might contain more than one origin, this has only been demonstrated recently. Two studies have shown that multiple origins of replication function in two archaeal species. One study identified two origins of replication in the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, whereas a second study used a different technique to show that both S. solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius have three functional origins. These are the first reports of archaea having multiple origins. This finding has implications for research on the mechanisms of DNA replication and evolution.',\n",
              "  'Sustained pain freedom and no adverse events as an endpoint in clinical trials of acute migraine treatments: application to patient-level data from a trial of the CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, and zolmitriptan. BACKGROUND: Endpoints used to evaluate the efficacy of acute anti-migraine drugs do not measure the tolerability. Sustained pain-free response with no adverse events has been recommended as a composite endpoint which measures the efficacy and tolerability attributes that patients desire. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate new composite efficacy-plus-tolerability endpoints based on a post-hoc analysis of patient-level data from a previous randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, telcagepant, and zolmitriptan in the acute treatment of migraine. Endpoints were 2-24-hour sustained pain freedom and no adverse events from 0-24 hours (SPF24NAE), 2-24 hour sustained pain relief and no adverse events from 0-24 hours (SPR24NAE), pain freedom at 2 hours and no adverse events from 0-24 hours (PF2NAE), and pain relief at 2 hours and no adverse events from 0-24 hours (PR2NAE). RESULTS: Compared with placebo, both telcagepant 300 mg and 150 mg achieved nominal superiority (p values <.05) for SPF24NAE, SPR24NAE, PF2NAE and PR2NAE. Zolmitriptan 5 mg showed nominal superiority versus placebo for SPF24NAE, SPR24NAE and PF2NAE, but not PR2NAE. Telcagepant 300 mg showed nominal superiority versus zolmitriptan for SPF24NAE, SPR24NA and PR2NAE. CONCLUSION: Composite efficacy-plus-tolerability endpoints may be useful for facilitating comparisons between treatments.',\n",
              "  'Nucleosomes are preferentially positioned at exons in somatic and sperm cells. Nucleosome positioning is constrained at eukaryotic transcription start sites and implicated in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, recent observations indicate that chromatin structure, transcription and splicing are functionally intertwined, and that modified nucleosomes with trimethylation of lysine 36 in histone subunit 3 (H3K36me3) are enriched at internal exons and the downstream flanking intronic regions of highly expressed genes. However, the position of nucleosomes in the interior of genes has been thought to be largely random. Here we show, by analysis of data sets from human sperm and T cells and medaka (Japanese killifish, Oryzias latipes) blastulae, that internal exons of genes are characterized by sharply elevated average nucleosome occupancy in comparison to flanking intronic sequences. We also show that the preferential positioning of nucleosomes at internal exons is independent of their modification status, and of the GC content, conservation or the expression level of the exon. These findings show that the location of exons is recorded in the chromatin structure and may be inherited across generations. Such embedded information may underpin transcriptionally coupled exon recognition and splice site selection.',\n",
              "  'Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment of multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is an established treatment of immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy. Since IVIG possesses multiple immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, IVIG therapy may represent a way of interfering with the disease process in multiple sclerosis (MS). In the MS animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), infusions of IVIG significantly reduced disease symptoms as well as the underlying CNS pathology. IVIG was only effective in EAE when administered in a prophylactic treatment protocol, since IVIG infusions during the established phase of EAE did not alter the disease course or the degree of inflammation found in the central nervous system. IVIG also has the potential to act through myelin repair mechanisms as evidenced by work done in the Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus model of demyelination. Together these observations have led to certain expectations for IVIG as a treatment for MS, and have resulted in various clinical trials. Several controlled trials report beneficial effects of IVIG on relapse rate, new MRI lesions, and disease progression in relapsing-remitting MS, while a remyelinating effect of IVIG has not been documented. IVIG is, therefore, presently regarded as a second-line therapy of MS.',\n",
              "  \"Autism spectrum conditions in myotonic dystrophy type 1: a study on 57 individuals with congenital and childhood forms. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by an expansion of a CTG triplet repeat in the DMPK gene. The aims of the present study were to classify a cohort of children with DM1, to describe their neuropsychiatric problems and cognitive level, to estimate the size of the CTG expansion, and to correlate the molecular findings with the neuropsychiatric problems. Fifty-seven children and adolescents (26 females; 31 males) with DM1 (CTG repeats > 40) were included in the study. The following instruments were used: Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), 5-15, Griffiths Mental Development Scales, and the Wechsler Scales. Based on age at onset and presenting symptoms, the children were divided into four DM1 groups; severe congenital (n = 19), mild congenital (n = 18), childhood (n = 18), and classical DM1 (n = 2). Forty-nine percent had an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic disorder was the most common diagnosis present in 35% of the subjects. Eighty-six percent of the individuals with DM1 had mental retardation (MR), most of them moderate or severe MR. ASD was significantly correlated with the DM1 form; the more severe the form of DM1, the higher the frequency of ASD. The frequency of ASD increased with increasing CTG repeat expansions. ASD and/or other neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's disorder were found in 54% of the total DM1 group. In conclusion, awareness of ASD comorbidity in DM1 is essential. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular etiology causing neurodevelopmental symptoms such as ASD and MR in DM1.\",\n",
              "  'Iron, brain and restless legs syndrome. Iron is the most important transitional metal in the body, as it is implicated in many metabolic processes, mostly related to its capacity as an electron donor/acceptor. Iron deficiency has been long been known to cause anaemia, iron excess to cause haemochromatosis. As excess free iron can cause oxidative damage, it is important that the levels of iron in the body are tightly regulated which appears to be done only by digestive absorption, as there is no known regulating mechanism for elimination of iron. The amount of free iron is also kept to a minimum thanks to binding to transferrin for transport, and to ferritin for storage. Recent research has put emphasis on the possible role of excess iron in the brain in several degenerative diseases. Iron deficiency in the central nervous system is known to cause motor impairment and cognitive deficits; more recently, it has been suggested that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the restless leg syndrome. 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd',\n",
              "  'One-year safety and tolerability profile of pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 1-year safety profile of the dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease. METHODS: Patients received pridopidine 45 mg/day for 4 weeks then pridopidine 90 mg/day for 22 weeks in this 6-month open-label extension (OLE) of the 6-month MermaiHD randomized controlled trial (RCT). Any adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Patients were categorized by their RCT treatment group (placebo, pridopidine 45 mg/day, pridopidine 90 mg/day). RESULTS: Of the 386 patients who completed the RCT, 353 entered the OLE and 305 (86.4%) completed. In 1 year, similar percentages of patients from each group reported > 1 AE (placebo, 79.6% [n = 90/113]; 45 mg/day, 80.8% [n = 101/125]; 90 mg/day, 82.6% [n = 95/115]) and > 1 serious AE (8.0% [n = 9/113], 12.8% [n = 16/125], and 8.7% [n = 10/115], respectively). The AE profile across both studies was similar; falls and worsening of chorea were most commonly reported. During the OLE, more patients previously receiving pridopidine reported > 1 AE (67.9% [n = 163/240]) than those who had received placebo (56.6% [n = 64/113]). Early in the RCT, small increases in heart rate were reported in patients receiving pridopidine. During 1 year, no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters or EKG-related safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSION: Pridopidine ( < 90 mg/day) has an acceptable safety profile and is well-tolerated for 1 year. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that pridopidine ( < 90 mg/day) is generally safe and well-tolerated in patients with Huntington disease for up to 1 year.',\n",
              "  'Inhibition of PCSK9 with evolocumab in homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (TESLA Part B): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is a rare, serious disorder caused by very low or absent plasma clearance of LDL, substantially raised LDL cholesterol, and accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. Conventional lipid-lowering treatments are modestly effective. Evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), reduced LDL cholesterol by 16% in a pilot study. We now report results with evolocumab in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial was undertaken at 17 sites in ten countries in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and South Africa. 50 eligible patients (aged > 12 years) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, on stable lipid-regulating therapy for at least 4 weeks, and not receiving lipoprotein apheresis, were randomly allocated by a computer-generated randomisation sequence in a 2:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous evolocumab 420 mg or placebo every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by LDL cholesterol at screening (<11 mmol/L or > 11 mmol/L) and implemented by a computerised interactive voice-response system. Patients, study personnel, and the funder were masked to treatment and to the efficacy results by the central laboratory not returning LDL cholesterol or any lipid results to the clinical sites after the baseline visit. The primary endpoint was percentage change in ultracentrifugation LDL cholesterol from baseline at week 12 compared with placebo, analysed by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01588496. FINDINGS: Of the 50 eligible patients randomly assigned to the two treatment groups, 49 actually received the study drug and completed the study (16 in the placebo group and 33 in the evolocumab group). Compared with placebo, evolocumab significantly reduced ultracentrifugation LDL cholesterol at 12 weeks by 30·9% (95% CI -43·9% to -18·0%; p<0·0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in ten (63%) of 16 patients in the placebo group and 12 (36%) of 33 in the evolocumab group. No serious clinical or laboratory adverse events occurred, and no anti-evolocumab antibody development was detected during the study. INTERPRETATION: In patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia receiving stable background lipid-lowering treatment and not on apheresis, evolocumab 420 mg administered every 4 weeks was well tolerated and significantly reduced LDL cholesterol compared with placebo.

This randomized, placebo-controlled within dose groups, double-blind, single rising dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 1 mg to 100 mg doses of empagliflozin in 48 healthy Japanese male subjects. Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels in 1.25 to 2.50 h; thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic fashion, with mean terminal elimination half-life ranging from 7.76 to 11.7 h. Increase in empagliflozin exposure was proportional to dose. Oral clearance was dose independent and ranged from 140 to 172 mL/min. In the 24 h following 100 mg empagliflozin administration, the mean (%CV) amount of glucose excreted in urine was 74.3 (17.1) g. The amount and the maximum rate of glucose excreted via urine increased with dose of empagliflozin. Nine adverse events, all of mild intensity, were reported by 8 subjects (7 with empagliflozin and 1 with the placebo). No hypoglycemia was reported. In conclusion, 1 mg to 100 mg doses of empagliflozin had a good safety and tolerability profile in healthy Japanese male subjects. Exposure to empagliflozin was dose proportional. The amount and rate of urinary glucose excretion were higher with empagliflozin than with the placebo, and increased with empagliflozin dose.',\n",
              "  'A patient with Pendred syndrome whose goiter progressed with normal serum thyrotropin and iodine organification. Biallelic mutations of SLC26A4 (encoding pendrin) cause Pendred syndrome (PS), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with deafness and goiter. The mechanism underlying the development of the goiter is unknown. Here, we report clinical and molecular findings of a patient with PS. This 27-year-old woman was born to nonconsanguineous healthy parents. She was seen at our hospital due to hearing loss at age 3 years, and subsequently developed goiter at age 10 years. From age 15 years, her thyroid gland showed progressive enlargement accompanied by elevation of serum thyroglobulin reaching 10-fold the normal amount. Thyroidal iodine uptake was also increased during goiter progression ((123)I uptake at 24 hr: 20.2% at age 17 years; 69.4% at age 24 years; reference, 8-40), while serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels and iodine organification (examined by the perchrolate or thiocyanate discharge test) remained normal. We sequenced SLC26A4 using standard PCR-based technique, and found one novel (p.T537P) and one recurrent (p.H723R) mutations in a compound heterozygous state. Expression experiments using COS-7 cells showed that the two mutants were entrapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and were poorly localized at the plasma membrane. In summary, a molecularly confirmed PS patient showed goiter progression accompanied by elevated serum thyroglobulin and increased thyroidal iodine uptake, but normal serum TSH levels and normal iodine organification. This implies that some pendrin mutations may involve direct stimulation of thyroid cell proliferation with no TSH hyperstimulation and no iodine organification defect.',\n",
              "  'Bach1 modulates heme oxygenase-1 expression in the neonatal mouse lung. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting enzyme of heme degradation and antioxidant defense protein, is induced in the lungs of animals exposed to hyperoxia. However, high levels of HO-1 expression may be deleterious, thus necessitating tight regulation. Previous reports show maturational differences in rat HO-1 regulation in hyperoxia, as newborns do not up-regulate HO-1mRNA compared with adults. To better understand the differential response of lung HO-1 to hyperoxia, we exposed newborn and adult mice to >95% oxygen. The newborn lungs had reduced HO-1 mRNA induction compared with adults and newborn transgenic mice over-expressing luciferase driven by the 15 kb HO-1 promoter (HO-1/Luc Tg) had less increased light emission in hyperoxia compared with adults. Compared with adults, levels of the repressor of HO-1 transcription, Bach1, were higher in the neonatal lung as was nuclear protein-DNA binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) from HO-1. Furthermore, at baseline and in hyperoxia, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed increased Bach1 binding to the HO-1 distal enhancers (DEs) in the neonates compared with adults. These data suggest that elevated levels of Bach1 may help to limit HO-1 induction in the newborn at baseline and in response to oxidative stress.',\n",
              "  'Potent inhibition of NFAT activation and T cell cytokine production by novel low molecular weight pyrazole compounds. NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) proteins are expressed in most immune system cells and regulate the transcription of cytokine genes critical for the immune response. The activity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN). Dephosphorylation of NFAT by CaN is required for NFAT nuclear localization. Current immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506 block CaN activity thus inhibiting nuclear translocation of NFAT and consequent cytokine gene transcription. The inhibition of CaN in cells outside of the immune system may contribute to the toxicities associated with cyclosporin A therapy. In a search for safer immunosuppressive drugs, we identified a series of 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole (BTP) derivatives that block Th1 and Th2 cytokine gene transcription. The BTP compounds block the activation-dependent nuclear localization of NFAT as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Confocal microscopy of cells expressing fluorescent-tagged NFAT confirmed that the BTP compounds block calcium-induced movement of NFAT from the cytosol to the nucleus. Inhibition of NFAT was selective because the BTP compounds did not affect the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcription factors. Treatment of intact T cells with the BTP compounds prior to calcium ionophore-induced activation of CaN caused NFAT to remain in a highly phosphorylated state. However, the BTP compounds did not directly inhibit the dephosphorylation of NFAT by CaN in vitro, nor did the drugs block the dephosphorylation of other CaN substrates including the type II regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and the transcription factor Elk-1. The data suggest that the BTP compounds cause NFAT to be maintained in the cytosol in a phosphorylated state and block the nuclear import of NFAT and, hence, NFAT-dependent cytokine gene transcription by a mechanism other than direct inhibition of CaN phosphatase activity. The novel inhibitors described herein will be useful in better defining the cellular regulation of NFAT activation and may lead to identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmune disease and transplant rejection.',\n",
              "  'Alteration in composition of keratin intermediate filaments in a model of breast cancer progression and the potential to reverse hallmarks of metastasis. BACKGROUND: In breast cancer the development of metastasis is a major turning point in the treatment and outcome of the disease. Throughout tumour development, and especially in the development of metastasis, epithelial mesenchymal transition takes place. During this transformation into a mesenchymal phenotype, the tumour cells undergo a series of structural changes. The loss of structural integrity and adoption of mesenchymal filaments enables cells to detach from the epithelial cell layer and metastasise. Keratins form the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton and provide scaffold structures within cells. During cancer progression the intermediate filaments are reorganised, and dramatic changes are seen in their protein components. Keratins K8, K18, K19 and vimentin are intermediate filament proteins with altered expression profiles during tumour development. METHOD: We have used in vivo and in vitro models to analyse changes in intermediate filament proteins. Antibody-based methods were used to study K8 levels and proteomic analysis to profile the protein content of metastatic breast cancer cell variants. RESULTS: K8 expression declines as human breast tumours progress into an invasive phenotype. Analysis of IF proteins indicated altered expression profiles of K8, K18, K19 and vimentin, with K8, K18, K19 expressed in high levels in the T47D and MCF-7 cell lines, whereas the highly metastatic cell lines expressed lower levels of K8 and K18 and no detectable K19. Vimentin showed reverse expression profile with T47D and MCF-7 cells having no detectable vimentin expression whereas the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 showed high levels. Analysis of acetylation status using specific antibodies suggested acetylation occurred within the central coiled domain in the MCF-7 and T47D cells. Inhibition of tumour growth by tissue factor (TF) shRNA resulted in a dramatic re-elevation of expression of K8 in xenographs of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-436 line. CONCLUSION: Intermediate filament expression alters during epithelial mesenchymal transition. Identified post translational modifications may play a role in alterations seen in the organisation, solubility and stability of these filaments. Epithelial mesenchymal transition can be reversed and an epithelial phenotype re-established.',\n",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) with restless leg syndrome (RLS) and the pathogenesis of RLS. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional and control study. The case group concluded 31 PD with RLS patients, meanwhile 39 PD patients were selected as the control group. Clinical history, clinical manifestations, complications and laboratory examinations were compared respectively between the two groups. RESULTS: All the RLS symptoms did not appear in RLS patients until the PD symptoms came out. Significant differences were found in complications such as swallow disturbance, constipation and illusion, when we compared the two PD groups (P < 0.05). Compared with the PD or healthy group, the level of serum ferritin and the H-reflex latency of tibial nerve were significantly decreased in PD with RLS group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Secondary RLS is a complication of PD. Deficiency of iron and decreased inhibition function of spinal cord may lead to the occurrence of RLS in PD patients. When their motor symptoms are serious and complications are more common, PD patients are more possible to have RLS symptoms.\",\n",
              "  'Phosphorylation of skeletal muscle calsequestrin enhances its Ca2+ binding capacity and promotes its association with junctin. Calcium signaling, intrinsic to skeletal and cardiac muscle function, is critically dependent on the amount of calcium stored within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calsequestrin, the main calcium buffer in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, provides a pool of calcium for release through the ryanodine receptor and acts as a luminal calcium sensor for the channel via its interactions with triadin and junctin. We examined the influence of phosphorylation of calsequestrin on its ability to store calcium, to polymerise and to regulate ryanodine receptors by binding to triadin and junctin. Our hypothesis was that these parameters might be altered by phosphorylation of threonine 353, which is located near the calcium and triadin/junctin binding sites. Although phosphorylation increased the calcium binding capacity of calsequestrin nearly 2-fold, it did not alter calsequestrin polymerisation, its binding to triadin or junctin or inhibition of ryanodine receptor activity at 1 mM luminal calcium. Phosphorylation was required for calsequestrin binding to junctin when calcium concentration was low (100 nM), and ryanodine receptors were activated by dephosphorylated calsequestrin when it bound to triadin alone. These novel data shows that phosphorylated calsequestrin is required for high capacity calcium buffering and suggest that ryanodine receptor inhibition by calsequestrin is mediated by junctin.',\n",

The authors report a female presenting with congenital heart defects, liver hemangiomas, and facial dysmorphisms admitted to hospital at 3 months of age because of feeding difficulties and poor growth. She had hypotonia and large tongue, \"coarse\" face, and umbilical hernia in presence of complex congenital cardiovascular malformations. In spite of normal neonatal screening we performed serum levels of thyroid hormones. Thyrotropin level was very high (>50 microU/ml; normal value 0.2-4 microU/ml), while serum free T(3) (FT3) and free T(4) (FT4) levels were normal (FT3 3.6 pg/ml, normal value 2.8-5.6 pg/ml; FT4 11.6 pg/ml, normal value 6.6-14 pg/ml); antithyroid autoantibodies were absent. Thyroid scintigraphy with sodium 99m Tc pertechnetate showed a small ectopic thyroid located in sublingual position, so treatment with L-thyroxine 37.5 microg/24 hr was started with rapid improvement of the clinical picture. At 17 months of age the patient developed the complete characteristic phenotype of Williams syndrome (WS); the clinical diagnosis was proven by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis which showed hemizygous deletion of the elastin gene on chromosome 7. Recently a case of thyroid hemiagenesis in a child with WS has been reported; our patient underscores the association of hypothyroidism and WS. Moreover, our case shows that clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may be present and the treatment may be necessary as it is in isolated congenital hypothyroidism.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the context of autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), which are caused by activating germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The aim of this study was to characterize the RET mutational spectrum in MEN2 families and apparently sporadic MTC (AS-MTC) cases originating from the central region of Portugal. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied a total of 82 individuals (64 affected and 18 family members), comprising five MEN2 families (four MEN2A and one MEN2B), as well as 53 AS-MTC cases. RET germline mutations were screened using PCR-DNA sequencing, SSCP and RFLP. The haplotypes associated with recurrent mutations were determined by fragment analysis of microsatellite markers, and by RFLP, in the case of intragenic polymorphisms. RESULTS: Frequency of the Cys611Tyr (TGC-TAC) mutation was significantly increased in this region of Portugal, due to the fact that three apparently unrelated MEN2A/FMTC families, out of the five in which mutations were identified, harboured this specific mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed that a common haplotype was shared between two of these three families. We have also characterized a novel RET mutation, Arg886Trp, located in the tyrosine kinase domain, which was found in an AS-MTC case. CONCLUSIONS: There are regional specificities in the relative frequency of RET mutations, which are consistent with a cluster-like distribution of specific disease-causing mutations, as a result of the inheritance of a shared haplotype. These data, along with the finding of a novel RET mutation (Arg886Trp), have important implications towards facilitating and improving the molecular diagnosis of hereditary MTC on a regional basis.',\n",
              "  'PARP inhibitor olaparib increases the oncolytic activity of dl922-947 in in vitro and in vivo model of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. PARP inhibitors are mostly effective as anticancer drugs in association with DNA damaging agents. We have previously shown that the oncolytic adenovirus dl922-947 induces extensive DNA damage, therefore we hypothesized a synergistic antitumoral effect of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in association with dl922-947. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma was chosen as model since it is a particularly aggressive tumor and, because of its localized growth, it is suitable for intratumoral treatment with oncolytic viruses. Here, we show that dl922-947 infection induces PARP activation, and we confirm in vitro and in vivo that PARP inhibition increases dl922-947 replication and oncolytic activity. In vitro, the combination with olaparib exacerbates the appearance of cell death markers, such as Annexin V positivity, caspase 3 cleavage, cytochrome C release and propidium iodide permeability. In vivo, we also observed a better viral distribution upon PARP inhibition. Changes in CD31 levels suggest a direct effect of olaparib on tumor vascularization and on the viral distribution within the tumor mass. The observation that PARP inhibition enhances the effects of dl922-947 is highly promising not only for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma but, in general, for the treatment of other tumors that could benefit from the use of oncolytic viruses.',\n",

Telomerase is an attractive therapeutic target because it is specific to cancer and critical for cancer cell immortality. We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT. Three MRT cell lines, BT-12, G401, and RT-peri, were treated with the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat. The effects of imetelstat on telomere length, DNA damage response, and cell proliferation were assessed. The efficacy of imetelstat in\\xa0vivo was evaluated in subcutaneous xenografts derived from each of the cell lines. Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked telomere shortening, and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as measured by formation of γ-H2AX nuclear foci, phosphorylation of ATM, and phosphorylation of TP53. Imetelstat-treated G401 cells underwent complete growth arrest after 16 passages. The other two cell lines exhibited growth inhibition. Imetelstat resulted in 40-50% growth inhibition compared to placebo-treated controls in all three xenograft models. The activity of imetelstat as a single agent suggests that further studies of telomerase inhibitors in combination with other agents may be warranted.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal, recessive lysosomal disorder with hematological and immunologic abnormalities; however, stem-cell transplantation from a matched or related donor may be curative. Many mutations of the CHS1/LYST gene have been reported to date. We report a novel nonsense mutation of the CHS1/LYST gene in 3 Omani patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three patients from 2 different families presented with clinical and laboratory features of CHS and a history of death of a previous sibling because of a severe illness, suggestive of the accelerated phase of CHS. Giant granules were present in the myeloid cell lines. Before the stem-cell transplant, the first patient underwent gene sequencing of all exons of the lysosome trafficking regulator (CHS1/LYST) gene and revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). Subsequently, upon presentation, the second and third patients' direct gene sequencing of exon 5 revealed the same mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We report a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). This supports the allelic heterogeneity of CHS and is in line with most reported mutation types that lead to a truncated protein. Identification of the mutation type will facilitate timely diagnosis, management, and family counseling for those with affected children in Oman.\",\n",
              "  'In vitro production and nuclear transfer affect dosage compensation of the X-linked gene transcripts G6PD, PGK, and Xist in preimplantation bovine embryos. Equal expression of X-linked genes such as G6PD and PGK in females and males and the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation are critically dependent on the expression of the X-inactive specific transcript (Xist). The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of in vitro production (IVP) and nuclear transfer (NT) on the relative abundance (RA) of the X-linked transcripts G6PD, PGK, and Xist in preimplantation bovine embryos. In experiment 1, sex-determined IVP or in vivo-produced embryos were analyzed for mRNA expression of the 3 genes. The sex ratio was 36% vs. 64% in IVP blastocysts and thus deviated significantly from the expected ratio of 50% in the vivo control group. The RA of G6PD transcripts was significantly higher in female IVP embryos than in male embryos. In contrast, no significant differences were seen between in vivo-derived female embryos and their male counterparts. At the morula stage, female IVP embryos transcribed significantly more PGK mRNA than did male embryos. However, blastocysts did not exhibit significant differences in PGK transcripts. No differences were observed for in vivo-derived embryos with regard to the RA of PGK transcripts. The RA of Xist mRNA was significantly higher in all female embryos than in their male counterparts. In experiment 2, IVP, in vivo-developed, NT-derived, and parthenogenetic embryos carrying two X chromosomes of either maternal and paternal origin or of maternal origin only (parthenogenotes) were analyzed for the RA of the 3 genes. In NT-derived morulae, the RA of G6PD transcripts was significantly increased compared with their IVP and in vivo-generated counterparts. G6PD transcript levels were significantly increased in IVP blastocysts compared with in vivo-generated and parthenogenetic embryos. At the morula stage, PGK transcripts were similar in all groups, but the RA of PGK transcripts was significantly higher in IVP blastocysts than in their in vivo-generated, parthenogenetic, and NT-derived counterparts. The RA of Xist was significantly elevated in NT-derived morulae compared with IVP, in vivo-generated, and parthenogenetic embryos. NT-derived blastocysts showed an increased Xist expression compared with that of IVP, in vivo-generated, and parthenogenetic embryos. Results of the present study show for the first time that differences in X-chromosome-linked gene transcript levels are related to a perturbed dosage compensation in female and male IVP and female NT-derived embryos. This finding warrants further studies to improve IVP systems and NT protocols to ensure the production of embryos with normal gene expression patterns.',\n",
              "  'Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, in subjects with renal impairment. AIMS: Empagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that inhibits renal glucose reabsorption and is being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In this open-label study, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of a 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was investigated in 40 subjects, grouped according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: Maximum empagliflozin plasma concentrations were similar in subjects with normal renal function and renal impairment. Area under the empagliflozin concentration-time curve (AUC0 -∞ ) values increased by approximately 18, 20, 66 and 48% in subjects with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and renal failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), respectively, in comparison to healthy subjects. This was attributed to decreased renal clearance (CLR ). Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) decreased with increasing renal impairment and correlated with decreased eGFR and CLR . Empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase in adverse events associated with renal impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Renal insufficiency resulted in decreased CLR of empagliflozin, moderately increased systemic exposure and decreased UGE. A single 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was well tolerated in subjects with normal renal function and any degree of renal impairment. The pharmacokinetic results of this study indicate that no dose adjustment of empagliflozin is required in patients with renal impairment.',\n",
              "  'Spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome. BACKGROUND: Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome with characteristic facial gestalt and mental retardation of variable severity. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene has been implicated as the major cause of Sotos syndrome, with a predominance of microdeletions reported in Japanese patients. This study was conducted to investigate into the spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome. METHODS: Thirty-six Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome and two patients with Weaver syndrome were subject to molecular testing. RESULTS: NSD1 gene mutations were detected in 26 (72%) Sotos patients. Microdeletion was found in only 3 patients, while the other 23 had point mutations (6 frameshift, 8 nonsense, 2 spice site, and 7 missense). Of these, 19 mutations were never reported. NSD1 gene mutations were not found in the two patients with Weaver syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of Sotos syndrome are caused by NSD1 gene defects, but the spectrum of mutations is different from that of Japanese patients. Genotype-phenotype correlation showed that patients with microdeletions might be more prone to congenital heart disease but less likely to have somatic overgrowth. The two patients with Weaver syndrome were not found to have NSD1 gene mutations, but the number was too small for any conclusion to be drawn.',\n",
              "  'Olaparib combined with chemotherapy for recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer: a randomised phase 2 trial. BACKGROUND: The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib has shown antitumour activity in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent, high-grade serous ovarian cancer with or without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of olaparib in combination with chemotherapy, followed by olaparib maintenance monotherapy, versus chemotherapy alone in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent, high-grade serous ovarian cancer. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 study, adult patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent, high-grade serous ovarian cancer who had received up to three previous courses of platinum-based chemotherapy and who were progression free for at least 6 months before randomisation received either olaparib (200 mg capsules twice daily, administered orally on days 1-10 of each 21-day cycle) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2), administered intravenously on day 1) and carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 4 mg/mL per min, according to the Calvert formula, administered intravenously on day 1), then olaparib monotherapy (400 mg capsules twice daily, given continuously) until progression (the olaparib plus chemotherapy group), or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) on day 1) and carboplatin (AUC 6 mg/mL per min on day 1) then no further treatment (the chemotherapy alone group). Randomisation was done by an interactive voice response system, stratified by number of previous platinum-containing regimens received and time to disease progression after the previous platinum regimen. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, analysed by intention to treat. Prespecified exploratory analyses included efficacy by BRCA mutation status, assessed retrospectively. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01081951, and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Feb 12 and July 30, 2010, 173 patients at 43 investigational sites in 12 countries were enrolled into the study, of whom 162 were eligible and were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (81 to the olaparib plus chemotherapy group and 81 to the chemotherapy alone group). Of these randomised patients, 156 were treated in the combination phase (81 in the olaparib plus chemotherapy group and 75 in the chemotherapy alone group) and 121 continued to the maintenance or no further treatment phase (66 in the olaparib plus chemotherapy group and 55 in the chemotherapy alone group). BRCA mutation status was known for 107 patients (either at baseline or determined retrospectively): 41 (38%) of 107 had a BRCA mutation (20 in the olaparib plus chemotherapy group and 21 in the chemotherapy alone group). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib plus chemotherapy group (median 12.2 months [95% CI 9.7-15.0]) than in the chemotherapy alone group (median 9.6 months [95% CI 9.1-9.7) (HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.34-0.77]; p=0.0012), especially in patients with BRCA mutations (HR 0.21 [0.08-0.55]; p=0.0015). In the combination phase, adverse events that were reported at least 10% more frequently with olaparib plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone were alopecia (60 [74%] of 81 vs 44 [59%] of 75), nausea (56 [69%] vs 43 [57%]), neutropenia (40 [49%] vs 29 [39%]), diarrhoea (34 [42%] vs 20 [27%]), headache (27 [33%] vs seven [9%]), peripheral neuropathy (25 [31%] vs 14 [19%]), and dyspepsia (21 [26%] vs 9 [12%]); most were of mild-to-moderate intensity. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events during the combination phase were neutropenia (in 35 [43%] of 81 patients in the olaparib plus chemotherapy group vs 26 [35%] of 75 in the chemotherapy alone group) and anaemia (seven [9%] vs five [7%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 12 (15%) of 81 patients in the olaparib plus chemotherapy group and 16 of 75 (21%) patients in the chemotherapy alone group. INTERPRETATION: Olaparib plus paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by maintenance monotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone, with the greatest clinical benefit in BRCA-mutated patients, and had an acceptable and manageable tolerability profile.

Histiocytoid cardiomyopathy, Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, Isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle, Long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome, are all well described. Congenital short QT syndrome is a new familial primary electrical disease of the heart, which is characterized by abnormally short QT interval and paroxysmal atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been suggested. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is an inherited disease and occurs in the absence of structural heart disease or known associated syndromes. Although the histological appearance of some of these disorders may be diagnostic, molecular analysis is necessary to define clearly the particular type of cardiomyopathy.',\n",

We hypothesized that because the XK gene is X-linked, it would be easy to identify spontaneously arising red cells with a phenotype resembling the McLeod syndrome, which results from inherited XK mutations. Here, by flow cytometry, we detect such phenotypic variants at a median frequency of 9 x 10(-6) in neonatal cord blood samples and 39 x 10(-6) in healthy adults (p=0.004). It may be possible to further investigate the relationship between aging, mutations, and cancer using this approach.',\n",
              "  'Novel vaccine peptide GV1001 effectively blocks β-amyloid toxicity by mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. GV1001 is a 16-amino-acid vaccine peptide derived from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence. We investigated the effects of GV1001 against β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in rat neural stem cells (NSCs). Primary culture NSCs were treated with several concentrations of GV1001 and/or Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer for 48 hours. GV1001 protected NSCs against the Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in a concentration-dependent manner. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ concentration dependently decreased viability, proliferation, and mobilization of NSCs and GV1001 treatment restored the cells to wild-type levels. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ increased free radical levels in rat NSCs while combined treatment with GV1001 significantly reduced these levels. In addition, GV1001 treatment of Aβ₂₅₋₃₅-injured NSCs increased the expression level of survival-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated survival proteins, and decreased the levels of death and inflammation-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated death proteins. Together, these results suggest that GV1001 possesses neuroprotective effects against Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in NSCs and that these effects are mediated through mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, including the induction of cellular proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects, mitochondrial stabilization, and anti-aging and anti-oxidant effects.',\n",

Self-rotation function analysis indicates the presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Biochemical data suggest that the blue colour of the protein is related to dimer formation. Sequence data for the protein are incomplete, but thus far have identified no model for molecular replacement.

              "  \"Up-regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in Friedreich's ataxia cells. The severe reduction in mRNA and protein levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin, encoded by the X25 gene, causes Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common form of recessive hereditary ataxia. Increasing evidence underlines the pathogenetic role of oxidative stress in this disease. We generated an in vitro cellular model of regulated human frataxin overexpression. We identified, by differential display technique, the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4 mRNA down regulation in frataxin overexpressing cells. We studied the stress kinases pathway in this cellular model and in fibroblasts from FRDA patients. Frataxin overexpression reduced c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, exposure of FRDA fibroblasts to several forms of environmental stress caused an up regulation of phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun. To understand if this susceptibility results in cell death, we have investigated the involvement of caspases. A significantly higher activation of caspase-9 was observed in FRDA versus control fibroblasts after serum-withdrawal. Our findings suggest the presence, in FRDA patient cells, of a 'hyperactive' stress signaling pathway. The role of frataxin in FRDA pathogenesis could be explained, at least in part, by this hyperactivity.\",\n",
              "  'TBC1D7 is a third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1. The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. Sequencing analyses of samples from TSC patients suggest that TBC1D7 is unlikely to represent TSC3. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.',\n",

Some missense mutations and small deletions in the NOTCH3 gene, not involving cysteine residues, have been described in patients considered to be affected by paucisymptomatic CADASIL. However, the significance of such molecular variants is still unclear. We describe a 49-year-old woman with a CADASIL-like phenotype, carrying a novel cysteine-sparing mutation in exon 29 of the NOTCH3 gene, and discuss the possible pathogenetic role of this molecular variant. Even though atypical clinical and MRI findings make a diagnosis of CADASIL unlikely in this patient, our report nevertheless underlines the intriguing genotype-phenotype relationship in NOTCH3 mutations and the importance of functional investigation to ascertain the role of new NOTCH3 mutations in CADASIL pathogenesis.',\n",
              "  'Pleiotropic and diverse expression of ZFHX1B gene transcripts during mouse and human development supports the various clinical manifestations of the \"Mowat-Wilson\" syndrome. ZFHX1B encodes Smad-interacting protein 1, a transcriptional corepressor involved in the transforming growth factors beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathway. ZFHX1B mutations cause a complex developmental phenotype characterized by severe mental retardation (MR) and multiple congenital defects. We compared the distribution of ZFHX1B transcripts during mouse and human embryogenesis as well as in adult mice and humans. This showed that this gene is strongly transcribed at an early stage in the developing peripheral and central nervous systems of both mice and humans, in all neuronal regions of the brains of 25-week human fetuses and adult mice, and at varying levels in numerous nonneural tissues. Northern blot analysis suggested that ZFHX1B undergoes tissue-specific alternative splicing in both species. These results strongly suggest that ZFHX1B determines the transcriptional levels of target genes in various tissues through the combinatorial interactions of its isoforms with different Smad proteins. Thus, as well as causing neural defects, ZFHX1B mutations may also cause other malformations.',\n",
              "  'Heme oxygenase 1 is induced by miR-155 via reduced BACH1 translation in endothelial cells. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is a stress-inducible enzyme that degrades redox-active heme-producing biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and Fe(2+). It protects cells under various stress conditions and mediates anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects in the endothelium. The expression of HMOX1, the HO-1 gene, is highly inducible and its transcriptional regulation is complex. HMOX1 is induced by various proinflammatory stimuli via NF-κB in human endothelial cells, but functional NF-κB-binding elements have not been identified from the human gene. However, the regulation of HMOX1 by the antioxidant-response element is firmly established, with the transcription factor BACH1 serving as a repressor and Nrf2 as an enhancer. miR-155 is one of the TNFα-inducible endothelial microRNAs predicted to bind to the BACH1 mRNA. Oligonucleotides mimicking miR-155 efficiently inhibited BACH1 protein translation, resulting in a concentration-dependent increase in HMOX1 mRNA and protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Moreover, endogenous miR-155 was upregulated by TNFα via an NF-κB-dependent mechanism with a subsequent increase in HMOX1 expression. We propose that increased HMOX1 expression in endothelial cells by TNFα results from miR-155-induced repression of BACH1 rather than direct induction of HMOX1 via NF-κB, and that miR-155 is cytoprotective during inflammation by elevating HO-1 expression in endothelial cells.',\n",
              "  'Effects of BCR-ABL inhibitors on anti-tumor immunity. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), BCR-ABL-mediated oncogenic signaling can be successfully targeted with the BCRABL- inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib leading to complete cytogenetic (Philadelphia chromosome not detectable upon cytogenetic testing of bone marrow) and even complete molecular (BCR-ABL not detectable by PCR in peripheral blood) responses. However, CML apparently can not be cured by BCR-ABL inhibitors alone, likely due to treatment-resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells, which provokes a relapse of disease after cessation of therapy. Evidence from patients treated with allogenic stem cell transplantation or IFN-α points to an important role of anti-tumor immunity for durable control of CML disease. Data from multiple in vitro and ex vivo studies indicate that BCR-ABL inhibitors may also influence anti-tumor immunity. Varying effects on different immune effector cell subsets and of the different compounds have been reported, the latter being due to their particular and diverse potency and spectrum of target kinases. As multiple approaches presently aim to combine BCR-ABL inhibition with immunotherapeutic strategies to improve disease control in CML, immunomodulatory effects of the available BCR-ABL inhibitors may be of direct clinical relevance. Here we review the available data regarding the effects of imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib on dendritic cells, T cells and natural killer cells as important cellular components of anti-tumor immunity.',\n",
              "  'Expression of DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalities such as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, developmental abnormality of fin muscle, disorganization of facial musculature and/or degeneration of trunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant localization of myogenic cells marked with α-actin promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside somite boundary, especially in head region. These abnormalities were rescued by coinjection of the short form of DUX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, even at extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FSHD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also propose that DUX4 expression during development is important for the pathogenesis of FSHD.',\n",

The Romano-Ward syndrome is of autosomal dominant inheritance, and the Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, with associated deafness, of autosomal recessive inheritance. The diagnosis is often delayed, but a careful history can avoid this. The syndromes can appear to be due to an imbalance in the sympathetic nerve to the ventricular myocardium, and precipitating causes such as stress suggest a CNS influence on this. The electrocardiogram can confirm the prolonged Q-T interval, but this is not always present, at least without an exercise test. Treatment with beta-blockers is often successful.

              "  'The CDK inhibitor p18Ink4c is a tumor suppressor in medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor which is thought to originate from cerebellar granule cell precursors (CGNPs) that fail to properly exit the cell cycle and differentiate. Although mutations in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway occur in 30% of cases, genetic alterations that account for MB formation in most patients have not yet been identified. We recently determined that the cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibitor, p18(Ink4c), is expressed as CGNPs exit the cell cycle, suggesting that this protein might play a central role in arresting the proliferation of these cells and in timing their subsequent migration and differentiation. In mice, disruption of Ink4c collaborates independently with loss of p53 or with inactivation of the gene (Ptc1) encoding the Shh receptor, Patched, to induce MB formation. Whereas loss of both Ink4c alleles is required for MB formation in a p53-null background, Ink4c is haplo-insufficient for tumor suppression in a Ptc(1+/-) background. Moreover, MBs derived from Ptc(1+/-) mice that lack one or two Ink4c alleles retain wild-type p53. Methylation of the INK4C (CDKN2C) promoter and complete loss of p18(INK4C) protein expression were detected in a significant fraction of human MBs again pointing toward a role for INK4C in suppression of MB formation.',\n",

Focal cortical dysplasias are a well-recognized cause of medically intractable seizures. The clinical relevance of certain subgroups of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification scheme remains to be determined. The aim of the present work is to assess the effect of the focal cortical dysplasia type Ib and Ic histologic subtypes on surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency. This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias. We retrospectively reviewed 91 focal cortical dysplasia patients (55% female; median age: 19 years (interquartile range 8-34); median seizure duration: 108 months (interquartile range 36-204)) with chronic epilepsy who underwent surgery. We compared the pathological subtypes, evaluating the patients' post-surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency according to the Engel's classification and the ILAE outcome classification. Both the ILAE classification scheme and Palmini et al classification scheme were utilized to classify the histologic subtype. Using χ(2) and Fisher's exact tests, we compared the post-surgical outcomes among these groups. Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB. After surgery, 44 patients (48%) were seizure-free. Crude analysis revealed no significant difference between patients with subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I concerning postoperative outcome according to the Engel and ILAE scoring systems on seizure frequency. Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB). In isolation, the histologic subtype of focal cortical dysplasia type I does not appear predictive of postoperative outcome.\",\n",

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder affecting one in 3,500 individuals. The mutation rate in the NF1 gene is one of the highest known for human genes. Compared to other methods, the protein truncation test (PTT) provides improved efficiency in detecting NF1 mutations which are dispersed throughout the gene which spans 350 kilobases of genomic DNA. We have applied the PTT and subsequent sequence analysis of cloned cDNA to identify mutations in NF1 patients. We report here the identification of two novel (W336X and Q315X), and one recurrent (R304X) mutation located in exon 7 and show that all three premature termination codons lead to skipping of exon 7 in a proportion of the transcripts derived from the mutated allele. Possible mutation-induced alterations of the RNA secondary structure and their impact on skipping of exon 7 of the NF1 gene are explored and discussed.',\n",

A novel, simple, specific, sensitive and reproducible high-performance liquid chromatography assay method has been developed and validated for the estimation of Orteronel in rat plasma. The bioanalytical procedure involves extraction of Orteronel and phenacetin (internal standard) from rat plasma with a simple liquid-liquid extraction process. The chromatographic analysis was performed on a Waters Alliance system using a gradient mobile phase conditions at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and a C18 column maintained at ambient room temperature.

Drugs that affect these enzymes may therefore have an impact on the pharmacological profile of bortezomib. This study evaluated the effects of co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin [rifampin]) and a weak CYP3A4 inducer (dexamethasone) on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profiles of bortezomib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged > 18 years with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle, for 3 cycles. In stage 1, patients were randomized (1 : 1) to receive bortezomib alone or in combination with oral rifampicin 600 mg once daily on days 4-10 during cycle 3 only. If the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of bortezomib was reduced by > 30% during rifampicin co-administration, then stage 2 was initiated, in which patients received bortezomib with dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on days 1-4 and days 9-12 during cycle 3 only. Blood samples were collected on days 11 through 14 of cycles 2 and 3 before and after bortezomib administration, at prespecified time points, for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (proteasome inhibition) assessments. RESULTS: Twelve patients in the bortezomib-alone arm, six patients in the bortezomib plus rifampicin arm and seven patients in the bortezomib plus dexamethasone arm were included in the pharmacokinetics-evaluable set. Rifampicin reduced the mean AUC from 0 to 72 hours (AUC(72h)) of bortezomib by approximately 45% (223 ng · h/mL in cycle 2 vs 123 ng · h/mL in cycle 3), while dexamethasone had no effect (mean AUC(72h): 179 ng · h/mL in cycle 2 vs 170 ng · h/mL in cycle 3). Proteasome inhibition parameters in peripheral blood were unaffected by rifampicin or dexamethasone. Safety profiles were similar across the treatment arms and consistent with previous experience of bortezomib. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, co-administration of rifampicin decreased the exposure to bortezomib but did not affect the proteasome inhibition or safety profiles; co-administration of dexamethasone did not affect the exposure to bortezomib, proteasome inhibition or safety profiles. Concomitant administration of bortezomib with strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin is not recommended, as it may result in a reduction of the clinical effect, whereas concomitant administration of weak CYP3A4 inducers such as dexamethasone does not affect the pharmacological profile of bortezomib.\",\n",
              "  'Chronic myelogenous leukemia with the e6a2 BCR-ABL and lacking imatinib response: presentation of two cases. The BCR-ABL fusion gene represents the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is derived from a translocation between chromosome 9 and 22. The majority of CML patients have a breakpoint in the major BCR region of the BCR gene giving rise to e13a2 or e14a2 BCR-ABL transcripts. Occasionally, other BCR breakpoints occur. The current report describes two e6a2 CML patients with imatinib treatment failure and unusual disease progression.

              "  'Oral factor Xa inhibitors for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prevention of stroke and systemic emboli is paramount in the management of atrial fibrillation. Although warfarin is the predominant anticoagulant used in patients with atrial fibrillation, it has significant limitations that have impeded appropriate use of stroke prophylaxis in eligible patients with atrial fibrillation. Consequently, much research has been focused on finding an alternative to warfarin. We review the potential alternatives in development and evaluate the current evidence concerning their safety and efficacy. RECENT FINDINGS: Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors are potentially well tolerated and effective replacements for warfarin. These agents do not require cofactors and offer selective inhibition at a critical step of amplification in the coagulation cascade. Multiple direct anti-factor Xa agents are currently undergoing evaluation in phase I, II, and III trials. Early results suggest that these novel anticoagulants have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with minimal-to-no requirements for therapeutic monitoring. Two direct factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation. The phase III trials of apixaban and rivaroxaban have completed enrollment and are in the follow-up phase. SUMMARY: Given the growing population of patients with atrial fibrillation, there is a great interest in finding new therapies for oral anticoagulation. The direct factor Xa inhibitors may offer several promising alternatives to warfarin therapy.',\n",
              "  'Delamanid for multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. BACKGROUND: Delamanid (OPC-67683), a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative, is a new antituberculosis medication that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis and has shown potent in vitro and in vivo activity against drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial, we assigned 481 patients (nearly all of whom were negative for the human immunodeficiency virus) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to receive delamanid, at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (161 patients) or 200 mg twice daily (160 patients), or placebo (160 patients) for 2 months in combination with a background drug regimen developed according to World Health Organization guidelines. Sputum cultures were assessed weekly with the use of both liquid broth and solid medium; sputum-culture conversion was defined as a series of five or more consecutive cultures that were negative for growth of M. tuberculosis. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth medium at 2 months. RESULTS: Among patients who received a background drug regimen plus 100 mg of delamanid twice daily, 45.4% had sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth at 2 months, as compared with 29.6% of patients who received a background drug regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compared with the placebo group, the group that received the background drug regimen plus 200 mg of delamanid twice daily had a higher proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment of sputum-culture conversion in solid medium. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were evenly distributed across groups. Although no clinical events due to QT prolongation on electrocardiography were observed, QT prolongation was reported significantly more frequently in the groups that received delamanid. CONCLUSIONS: Delamanid was associated with an increase in sputum-culture conversion at 2 months among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. This finding suggests that delamanid could enhance treatment options for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

              "  'Suvorexant: a dual orexin receptor antagonist for the treatment of sleep onset and sleep maintenance insomnia. OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy, safety, and pharmacology data available for suvorexant and determine its role in therapy as compared with other agents available for the treatment of insomnia. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search using the terms suvorexant and MK-4305 (the original name given to suvorexant during early trials) was conducted in December 2014 to identify initial literature sources. No time frame was used for exclusion of older trials. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Animal studies and trials written in a language other than English were excluded. Abstracts of the remaining trials were evaluated for determination of relevance to this review. References from these studies along with suvorexant prescriber information were used to identify additional literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were identified showing suvorexant to be safe, effective, and tolerable for the treatment of insomnia. After 4 weeks of therapy, relative to placebo, the 10- and 20-mg doses improved subjective total sleep time (22.3 and 49.9 minutes, respectively), wake after sleep onset (-21.4 and -28.1 minutes), and latency to persistent sleep (-2.3 and -22.3 minutes). CONCLUSION: Suvorexant is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of insomnia. Clinical trials have shown that it is relatively safe and effective for the treatment of both sleep onset and sleep maintenance at doses of 20 mg or less. Higher doses were studied but not approved because of concerns for next-day somnolence and effects on driving. Further studies are needed to assess this medication in patients with a history of addiction, because they were excluded from clinical trials, as well as to compare suvorexant with other insomnia medications available because no head-to-head studies have yet been conducted. However, its novel mechanism of action and theoretically lower addiction liability make suvorexant an appealing new option.',\n",
              "  'Structural insight into maintenance methylation by mouse DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1). Methylation of cytosine in DNA plays a crucial role in development through inheritable gene silencing. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is responsible for the propagation of methylation patterns to the next generation via its preferential methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites in the genome; however, how Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns is not fully understood. Here we report the crystal structure of the large fragment (291-1620) of mouse Dnmt1 and its complexes with cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine and its product S-adenosyl-L-homocystein. Notably, in the absence of DNA, the N-terminal domain responsible for targeting Dnmt1 to replication foci is inserted into the DNA-binding pocket, indicating that this domain must be removed for methylation to occur. Upon binding of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the catalytic cysteine residue undergoes a conformation transition to a catalytically competent position. For the recognition of hemimethylated DNA, Dnmt1 is expected to utilize a target recognition domain that overhangs the putative DNA-binding pocket. Taking into considerations the recent report of a shorter fragment structure of Dnmt1 that the CXXC motif positions itself in the catalytic pocket and prevents aberrant de novo methylation, we propose that maintenance methylation is a multistep process accompanied by structural changes.',\n",
              "  'Hypermethylation of the CpG dinucleotide in epidermal growth factor receptor codon 790: implications for a mutational hotspot leading to the T790M mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer. Nearly one half of all cases of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are due to the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20. The T790M mutation is a C→T transition mutation at a CpG dinucleotide. DNA methylation of cytosine (5-methylcytosine (5-mC)) in CpG dinucleotides is a common DNA modification; CpG dinucleotides are considered to be mutational hotspots that cause genetic diseases and cancers through spontaneous deamination of 5-mC, resulting in C→T transition mutations. This study aimed to examine the methylation level of cytosine of EGFR codon 790 and investigate whether DNA methylation was involved in acquiring the T790M mutation. We examined 18 NSCLC tumor tissues, 7 normal lymph node tissues, and 4 NSCLC cell lines (PC9, HCC827, 11-18, and A549). 5-mC was checked by bisulfite sequencing and quantified by pyrosequencing. We found that all tissue samples and cell lines had 5-mC in EGFR codon 790. The 5-mC range was 58.4-90.8%. Our results imply that hypermethylation of the CpG dinucleotide in EGFR codon 790 leads to the C→T transition mutation, causing resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment.',\n",
              "  \"Post-surgical outcome for epilepsy associated with type I focal cortical dysplasia subtypes. Focal cortical dysplasias are a well-recognized cause of medically intractable seizures. The clinical relevance of certain subgroups of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification scheme remains to be determined. The aim of the present work is to assess the effect of the focal cortical dysplasia type Ib and Ic histologic subtypes on surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency. This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias. We retrospectively reviewed 91 focal cortical dysplasia patients (55% female; median age: 19 years (interquartile range 8-34); median seizure duration: 108 months (interquartile range 36-204)) with chronic epilepsy who underwent surgery. We compared the pathological subtypes, evaluating the patients' post-surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency according to the Engel's classification and the ILAE outcome classification. Both the ILAE classification scheme and Palmini et al classification scheme were utilized to classify the histologic subtype. Using χ(2) and Fisher's exact tests, we compared the post-surgical outcomes among these groups. Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB. After surgery, 44 patients (48%) were seizure-free. Crude analysis revealed no significant difference between patients with subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I concerning postoperative outcome according to the Engel and ILAE scoring systems on seizure frequency. Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB). In isolation, the histologic subtype of focal cortical dysplasia type I does not appear predictive of postoperative outcome.\",\n",
              "  'Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha mediates activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and cytosolic phospholipase A2 in norepinephrine-induced arachidonic acid release in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells. We have investigated the contribution of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) in norepinephrine (NE)-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). NE enhanced release of AA via activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) but not secretory PLA2 in VSMC prelabeled with [3H]AA. NE (10 microM) enhanced CaM kinase II and MAP kinase activity. In cells transiently transfected with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the translation initiation sites of CaM kinase II and MAP kinase, NE-induced AA release was inhibited by 100 and 35% respectively. Treatment of cells with PD-098059, a MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, or with MAP kinase antisense oligonucleotide reduced NE-induced activation of MAP kinase and cPLA2. NE-induced MAP kinase and cPLA2 activation was also inhibited in cells treated with a CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN-93, or with CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotide. On the other hand, inhibition of MAP kinase kinase with PD-098059 or of MAP kinase with antisense oligonucleotides did not alter the NE-induced increase in CaM kinase II activity. Phosphorylation of MAP kinase and CaM kinase II by NE, studied by 32P incorporation and immune complex kinase assays, was inhibited by KN-93. Collectively, these data suggest that CaM kinase II can activate MAP kinase, which in turn activates cPLA2 to release AA for prostacyclin synthesis in the rabbit VSMC. This novel pathway for activation of MAP kinase by CaM kinase II appears to be mediated through stimulation of MAP kinase kinase. Activation of adrenergic receptors with NE in VSMC caused translocation of CaM kinase II, MAP kinase, and cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Okadaic acid, which increased phosphorylation and activity, did not translocate these enzymes. Therefore, it appears that in rabbit VSMC, NE, by promoting extracellular Ca2+ influx, increases CaM kinase II activity, leading to activation of MAP kinase and cPLA2 and translocation to the nuclear envelope, resulting in release of AA from the nuclear envelope for prostacyclin synthesis.',\n",
              "  \"Two novel exonic point mutations in HEXA identified in a juvenile Tay-Sachs patient: role of alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. We have identified three mutations in the beta-hexoseaminidase A (HEXA) gene in a juvenile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) patient, which exhibited a reduced level of HEXA mRNA. Two mutations are novel, c.814G>A (p.Gly272Arg) and c.1305C>T (p.=), located in exon 8 and in exon 11, respectively. The third mutation, c.1195A>G (p.Asn399Asp) in exon 11, has been previously characterized as a common polymorphism in African-Americans. Hex A activity measured in TSD Glial cells, transfected with HEXA cDNA constructs bearing these mutations, was unaltered from the activity level measured in normal HEXA cDNA. Analysis of RT-PCR products revealed three aberrant transcripts in the patient, one where exon 8 was absent, one where exon 11 was absent and a third lacking both exons 10 and 11. All three novel transcripts contain frameshifts resulting in premature termination codons (PTCs). Transfection of mini-gene constructs carrying the c.814G>A and c.1305C>T mutations proved that the two mutations result in exon skipping. mRNAs that harbor a PTC are detected and degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway to prevent synthesis of abnormal proteins. However, although NMD is functional in the patient's fibroblasts, aberrant transcripts are still present. We suggest that the level of correctly spliced transcripts as well as the efficiency in which NMD degrade the PTC-containing transcripts, apparently plays an important role in the phenotype severity of the unique patient and thus should be considered as a potential target for drug therapy.\",\n",

Transposons have been promising elements for gene integration, and the Sleeping Beauty (SB) system has been the major one for many years, although there have been several other transposon systems available, for example, Tol2. However, recently another system known as PiggyBac (PB) has been introduced and developed for fulfilling the same purposes, for example, mutagenesis, transgenesis and gene therapy and in some cases with improved transposition efficiency and advantages over the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, although improved hyperactive transposase has highly increased the transposition efficacy for SB. The PB systems have been used in many different scientific research fields; therefore, the purpose of this review is to describe some of these versatile uses of the PiggyBac system to give readers an overview on the usage of PiggyBac system.',\n",
              "  'BHLHB3: a candidate tumor suppressor in lung cancer. BHLHB3 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain-containing protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor. We found that BHLHB3 transcript levels were low in three human lung cancer cell lines and downregulated in human lung adenocarcinomas as compared to normal lung tissue. BHLHB3 gene overexpression inhibited colony formation of A549, NCI-H520 and NCI-H596 lung cancer cells. The reduced colony growth was likely due to inhibition of cell proliferation as suggested by the downregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression in NCI-H520 cells transfected to overexpress the BHLHB3 gene; no evidence of apoptosis was observed. These results point to the potential role of the BHLHB3 protein as a tumor suppressor for lung cancer.',\n",
              "  'One novel Dravet syndrome causing mutation and one recurrent MAE causing mutation in SCN1A gene. Mutations in SCN1A gene, encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel α1-subunit, are found to be associated with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy or Dravet syndrome (DS), but only rarely with the myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE, or Doose syndrome). We report on two patients with SCN1A mutations and severe epilepsy within the spectrum of generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus syndrome (GEFS+), the phenotypes being consistent with DS and MAE, respectively. Analysis of SCN1A revealed a heterozygous de novo frameshift mutation (c.4205_4208delGAAA) in the patient with DS, and a recurrent missense mutation (c.3521C>G) in that suffering from MAE. The missense mutation has been reported in patients with neurological diseases of various manifestations, which suggests that this variability is likely to result from the modifying effects of other genetic or environmental factors. DS phenotype has been mainly found associated with truncation mutations, while predominantly missense mutations and very few prematurely terminating substitutions have been reported in GEFS+ patients.',\n",
              "  'Dysregulation of 4q35- and muscle-specific genes in fetuses with a short D4Z4 array linked to facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy. Facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy (FSHD) results from deletions in the subtelomeric macrosatellite D4Z4 array on the 4q35 region. Upregulation of the DUX4 retrogene from the last D4Z4 repeated unit is thought to underlie FSHD pathophysiology. However, no one knows what triggers muscle defect and when alteration arises. To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease, we evaluated at the molecular level, the perturbation linked to the FSHD genotype with no a priori on disease onset, severity or penetrance and prior to any infiltration by fibrotic or adipose tissue in biopsies from fetuses carrying a short pathogenic D4Z4 array (n = 6) compared with fetuses with a non-pathogenic D4Z4 array (n = 21). By measuring expression of several muscle-specific markers and 4q35 genes including the DUX4 retrogene by an RT-PCR and western blotting, we observed a global dysregulation of genes involved in myogenesis including MYOD1 in samples with <11 D4Z4. The DUX4-fl pathogenic transcript was detected in FSHD biopsies but also in controls. Importantly, in FSHD fetuses, we mainly detected the non-spliced DUX4-fl isoform. In addition, several other genes clustered at the 4q35 locus are upregulated in FSHD fetuses. Our study is the first to examine fetuses carrying an FSHD-linked genotype and reveals an extensive dysregulation of several muscle-specific and 4q35 genes at early development stage at a distance from any muscle defect. Overall, our work suggests that even if FSHD is an adult-onset muscular dystrophy, the disease might also involve early molecular defects arising during myogenesis or early differentiation.',\n",
              "  \"Impact of training for healthcare professionals on how to manage an opioid overdose with naloxone: effective, but dissemination is challenging. BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose has a high mortality, but is often reversible with appropriate overdose management and naloxone (opioid antagonist). Training in these skills has been successfully trialled internationally with opioid users themselves. Healthcare professionals working in substance misuse are in a prime position to deliver overdose prevention training to drug users and may themselves witness opioid overdoses. The best method of training dissemination has not been identified. The study assessed post-training change in clinician knowledge for managing an opioid overdose and administering naloxone, evaluated the 'cascade method' for disseminating training, and identified barriers to implementation. METHODS: A repeated-measures design evaluated knowledge pre-and-post training. A sub-set of clinicians were interviewed to identify barriers to implementation. Clinicians from addiction services across England received training. Participants self-completed a structured questionnaire recording overdose knowledge, confidence and barriers to implementation. RESULTS: One hundred clinicians were trained initially, who trained a further 119 clinicians (n=219) and thereafter trained 239 drug users. The mean composite score for opioid overdose risk signs and actions to be taken was 18.3/26 (±3.8) which increased to 21.2/26 (±4.1) after training, demonstrating a significant improvement in knowledge (Z=9.2, p<0.001). The proportion of clinicians willing to use naloxone in an opioid overdose rose from 77% to 99% after training. Barriers to implementing training were clinician time and confidence, service resources, client willingness and naloxone formulation. CONCLUSIONS: Training clinicians how to manage an opioid overdose and administer naloxone was effective. However the 'cascade method' was only modestly successful for disseminating training to a large clinician workforce, with a range of clinician and service perceived obstacles. Drug policy changes and improvements to educational programmes for drug services would be important to ensure successful implementation of overdose training internationally.\",\n",
              "  \"Intravenous vs subcutaneous naloxone for out-of-hospital management of presumed opioid overdose. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether naloxone administered i.v. to out-of-hospital patients with suspected opioid overdose would have a more rapid therapeutic onset than naloxone given subcutaneously (s.q.). METHODS: A prospective, sequential, observational cohort study of 196 consecutive patients with suspected opioid overdose was conducted in an urban out-of-hospital setting, comparing time intervals from arrival at the patient's side to development of a respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min, and durations of bag-valve-mask ventilation. Subjects received either naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. (n = 74) or naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. (n = 122), for respiratory depression of <10 breaths/min. RESULTS: Mean interval from crew arrival to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min was 9.3 +/- 4.2 min for the i.v. group vs 9.6 +/- 4.58 min for the s.q. group (95% CI of the difference -1.55, 1.00). Mean duration of bag-valve-mask ventilation was 8.1 +/- 6.0 min for the i.v. group vs 9.1 +/- 4.8 min for the s.q. group. Cost of materials for administering naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. was $12.30/patient, compared with $10.70/patient for naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. CONCLUSION: There was no clinical difference in the time interval to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min between naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. and naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. for the out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected opioid overdose. The slower rate of absorption via the s.q. route was offset by the delay in establishing an i.v.\",\n",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate the morphologic appearances of small-bowel lymphoma using MR enterography to identify key morphologic traits capable of providing an association between imaging manifestations and likely histologic diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 54-month period, 10 patients with subsequently confirmed small-bowel lymphoma were imaged using a standardized MR enterography technique. Retrospective chart review was performed to detect associated disease processes, such as celiac disease. The morphologic characteristics of each segment with lymphomatous involvement were evaluated with respect to tumor location, tumor size, mural characteristics, fold features, loop dilatation, luminal stricturing, mesenteric or antimesenteric distribution, mesenteric involvement, and signal intensity. RESULTS: Nineteen distinct segments of lymphomatous involvement were identified in 10 patients, and underlying celiac disease was confirmed in six of the 10 patients. This patient group comprised 10 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of various subtypes. No cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma were encountered. Analysis revealed celiac NHL enteropathy to have a tendency toward localization to a single, long (> 10 cm), smooth continuous bowel segment, often with aneurysmal loop dilatation, in the absence of a distinct mesenteric or antimesenteric distribution. Luminal stricturing was encountered in cases of low-grade lymphoma, whereas mesenteric fat infiltration represented a characteristic of high-grade disease. CONCLUSION: We describe the characteristics of small-bowel lymphoma on MR enterography, identifying a number of key features that may help the interpreting radiologist in suggesting the underlying histologic subtype and whether the presence of underlying celiac disease is likely.\",\n",
              "  'Green tea polyphenols block the anticancer effects of bortezomib and other boronic acid-based proteasome inhibitors. The anticancer potency of green tea and its individual components is being intensely investigated, and some cancer patients already self-medicate with this \"miracle herb\" in hopes of augmenting the anticancer outcome of their chemotherapy. Bortezomib (BZM) is a proteasome inhibitor in clinical use for multiple myeloma. Here, we investigated whether the combination of these compounds would yield increased antitumor efficacy in multiple myeloma and glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Unexpectedly, we discovered that various green tea constituents, in particular (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and other polyphenols with 1,2-benzenediol moieties, effectively prevented tumor cell death induced by BZM in vitro and in vivo. This pronounced antagonistic function of EGCG was evident only with boronic acid-based proteasome inhibitors (BZM, MG-262, PS-IX), but not with several non-boronic acid proteasome inhibitors (MG-132, PS-I, nelfinavir). EGCG directly reacted with BZM and blocked its proteasome inhibitory function; as a consequence, BZM could not trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress or caspase-7 activation, and did not induce tumor cell death. Taken together, our results indicate that green tea polyphenols may have the potential to negate the therapeutic efficacy of BZM and suggest that consumption of green tea products may be contraindicated during cancer therapy with BZM.',\n",
              "  \"Flumazenil's reversal of myoclonic-like movements associated with midazolam in term newborns. Sedation is an important aspect of care for critically ill newborns. Proper sedation reduces stress during procedures such as mechanical ventilation. Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, is widely administered as a sedative in newborn intensive care units but is not without side effects. Three term newborns developed myoclonic-like abnormal movements after receiving midazolam. In one, flumazenil controlled the abnormal movements. Flumazenil is a potent benzodiazepine antagonist that competitively blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines. It can reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines occurring after diagnostic or therapeutic procedures or after benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil may be considered in cases of abnormal movements associated with midazolam. However, further studies are needed to provide guidelines for the administration of this drug in newborns.\",\n",
              "  'Telomerase inhibition abolishes the tumorigenicity of pediatric ependymoma tumor-initiating cells. Pediatric ependymomas are highly recurrent tumors resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein critical in permitting limitless replication, has been found to be critically important for the maintenance of tumor-initiating cells (TICs). These TICs are chemoresistant, repopulate the tumor from which they are identified, and are drivers of recurrence in numerous cancers. In this study, telomerase enzymatic activity was directly measured and inhibited to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting telomerase. Telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) (n\\xa0=\\xa036) and C-circle assay/telomere FISH/ATRX staining (n\\xa0=\\xa076) were performed on primary ependymomas to determine the prevalence and prognostic potential of telomerase activity or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) as telomere maintenance mechanisms, respectively. Imetelstat, a phase 2 telomerase inhibitor, was used to elucidate the effect of telomerase inhibition on proliferation and tumorigenicity in established cell lines (BXD-1425EPN, R254), a primary TIC line (E520) and xenograft models of pediatric ependymoma. Over 60\\xa0% of pediatric ependymomas were found to rely on telomerase activity to maintain telomeres, while no ependymomas showed evidence of ALT. Children with telomerase-active tumors had reduced 5-year progression-free survival (29\\xa0±\\xa011 vs 64\\xa0±\\xa018\\xa0%; p\\xa0=\\xa00.03) and overall survival (58\\xa0±\\xa012 vs 83\\xa0±\\xa015\\xa0%; p\\xa0=\\xa00.05) rates compared to those with tumors lacking telomerase activity. Imetelstat inhibited proliferation and self-renewal by shortening telomeres and inducing senescence in vitro.

              "  \"Enhancement of adaptive immunity by the human vaccine adjuvant AS01 depends on activated dendritic cells. Adjuvant System AS01 is a liposome-based vaccine adjuvant containing 3-O-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid A and the saponin QS-21. AS01 has been selected for the clinical development of several candidate vaccines including the RTS,S malaria vaccine and the subunit glycoprotein E varicella zoster vaccine (both currently in phase III). Given the known immunostimulatory properties of MPL and QS-21, the objective of this study was to describe the early immune response parameters after immunization with an AS01-adjuvanted vaccine and to identify relationships with the vaccine-specific adaptive immune response. Cytokine production and innate immune cell recruitment occurred rapidly and transiently at the muscle injection site and draining lymph node postinjection, consistent with the rapid drainage of the vaccine components to the draining lymph node. The induction of Ag-specific Ab and T cell responses was dependent on the Ag being injected at the same time or within 24 h after AS01, suggesting that the early events occurring postinjection were required for these elevated adaptive responses. In the draining lymph node, after 24 h, the numbers of activated and Ag-loaded monocytes and MHCII(high) dendritic cells were higher after the injection of the AS01-adjuvanted vaccine than after Ag alone. However, only MHCII(high) dendritic cells appeared efficient at and necessary for direct Ag presentation to T cells. These data suggest that the ability of AS01 to improve adaptive immune responses, as has been demonstrated in clinical trials, is linked to a transient stimulation of the innate immune system leading to the generation of high number of efficient Ag-presenting dendritic cells.\",\n",
              "  'Heme induces ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription factor Bach1. The transcription repressor Bach1 is a sensor and effector of heme that regulates the expression of heme oxygenase 1 and globin genes. Heme binds to Bach1, inhibiting its DNA binding activity and inducing its nuclear export. We found that hemin further induced the degradation of endogenous Bach1 in NIH 3T3 cells, murine embryonic fibroblasts, and murine erythroleukemia cells. In contrast, succinylacetone, an inhibitor of heme synthesis, caused accumulation of Bach1 in murine embryonic fibroblasts, indicating that physiological levels of heme regulated the Bach1 turnover. Polyubiquitination and rapid degradation of overexpressed Bach1 were induced by hemin treatment. HOIL-1, an ubiquitin-protein ligase which recognizes heme-bound, oxidized iron regulatory protein 2, was found to bind with Bach1 when both were overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells. HOIL-1 stimulated the polyubiquitination of Bach1 in a purified in vitro ubiquitination system depending on the intact heme binding motifs of Bach1. Expression of dominant-negative HOIL-1 in murine erythroleukemia cells resulted in higher stability of endogenous Bach1, raising the possibility that the heme-regulated degradation involved HOIL-1 in murine erythroleukemia cells. These results suggest that heme within a cell regulates the polyubiquitination and degradation of Bach1.',\n",
              "  'The S-methylmethionine cycle in angiosperms: ubiquity, antiquity and activity. Angiosperms synthesize S-methylmethionine (SMM) from methionine (Met) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in a unique reaction catalyzed by Met S-methyltransferase (MMT). SMM serves as methyl donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine, catalyzed by homocysteine S-methyltransferase (HMT). MMT and HMT together have been proposed to constitute a futile SMM cycle that stops the free Met pool from being depleted by an overshoot in AdoMet synthesis. Arabidopsis and maize have one MMT gene, and at least three HMT genes that belong to two anciently diverged classes and encode enzymes with distinct properties and expression patterns. SMM, and presumably its cycle, must therefore have originated before dicot and monocot lineages separated. Arabidopsis leaves, roots and developing seeds all express MMT and HMTs, and can metabolize [35S]Met to [35S]SMM and vice versa. The SMM cycle therefore operates throughout the plant. This appears to be a general feature of angiosperms, as digital gene expression profiles show that MMT and HMT are co-expressed in leaves, roots and reproductive tissues of maize and other species. An in silico model of the SMM cycle in mature Arabidopsis leaves was developed from radiotracer kinetic measurements and pool size data. This model indicates that the SMM cycle consumes half the AdoMet produced, and suggests that the cycle serves to stop accumulation of AdoMet, rather than to prevent depletion of free Met. Because plants lack the negative feedback loops that regulate AdoMet pool size in other eukaryotes, the SMM cycle may be the main mechanism whereby plants achieve short-term control of AdoMet level.',\n",
              "  'APOBEC3B and APOBEC3F inhibit L1 retrotransposition by a DNA deamination-independent mechanism. The most common transposable genetic element in humans, long interspersed element 1 (L1), constitutes about 20% of the genome. The activity of L1 and related transposons such as Alu elements causes disease and contributes to speciation. Little is known about the cellular mechanisms that control their spread. We show that expression of human APOBEC3B or APOBEC3F decreased the rate of L1 retrotransposition by 5-10-fold. Expression of two related proteins, APOBEC3D or APOBEC3G, had little effect. The mechanism of L1 inhibition did not correlate with an obvious subcellular protein distribution as APOBEC3B appeared predominantly nuclear and APOBEC3F was mostly cytosolic. Two lines of evidence indicated that these APOBEC3 proteins use a deamination-independent mechanism to inhibit L1. First, a catalytically inactive APOBEC3B mutant maintained L1 inhibition activity. Second, cDNA strand-specific C --> T hypermutations were not detected among L1 elements that had replicated in the presence of APOBEC3B or APOBEC3F. In addition, lower levels of retrotransposed L1 DNA accumulated in the presence of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3F. Together, these data combined to suggest a model in which APOBEC3B or APOBEC3F provide a preintegration barrier to L1 retrotransposition. A particularly high level of APOBEC3F protein in human testes and an inverse correlation between L1 activity and APOBEC3 gene number suggest the relevance of this mechanism to mammals.',\n",
              "  'Evaluation of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor - betrixaban. INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therapy for treatment and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The emergence of two new classes of orally administered anticoagulants, direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape in the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between betrixaban and currently available novel anticoagulants and future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acute coronary syndromes is yet to be defined based on clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currently, there are no specific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants. The availability of an effective reversal agent would be very attractive for the management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or the need for emergent surgery.',\n",
              "  \"A targeted therapy for protein and lipid kinases in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Protein kinases (PKs) and lipid kinases (LKs) are good choices for targets of signal transduction therapy as these enzymes are involved in signaling pathways, and are often related to the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. The attractiveness of PKs and LKs as drug able targets is enhanced by the fact that they are enzymes whose biological activity can be turned off by drugs that block their catalytic site. In the last few years small molecular kinase inhibitors (KIs) have been synthesized and become available for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The first KI, introduced into clinical practice in 1998, was imatinib mesylate, which became the first choice drug in chronic myeloid leukemia. More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263). These agents are currently evaluated in early clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other diseases. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors, flavopiridol (alvocidib), BMS-387032 (SNS-032), sunitinib and sorafenib are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory CLL. Multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors including vandetanib (ZD6474) bosutinib (SKI-606), TKI258 (CHIR-258), pazopanib (GW786034) and axitinib (AG013736) have been also developed for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K ) are a family of lipid kinases that mediate signals from cell surface receptors. CAL-101 (GS-1101) is an oral PI3Kδ-specific inhibitor which has shown preclinical and clinical activity against CLL. This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties and clinical activity and toxicity of PK and LK inhibitors in CLL.\",\n",
              "  'Alpha- and beta-synuclein expression in Parkinson disease with and without dementia. Parkinson disease (PD) is the most important movement disorder and about 50% of patients develop dementia over the time. PD belongs to the group of Lewy body disorders. Alpha-synuclein (AS) is the main component of Lewy bodies and its aggregation is a key event in the pathogenesis of PD. Beta-synuclein (BS) inhibits AS aggregation in vitro and in vivo and has been shown to interact directly with AS regulating its functionality and preventing its oligomerization. Recently, we have described a molecular subgroup of DLB characterized by the drastic BS reduction in cortical areas. In this study we have analyzed the expression of two BS transcripts and the main AS transcript SNCA140, in frozen samples of three brain areas, temporal cortex, caudate nucleus and pons, from patients with PD and PDD in comparison with controls. Relative mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR with SybrGreen, neuron-specific-enolase as housekeeping gene and the deltadeltaCt method. The most important difference in BS and AS mRNA expression between PD and PDD was found in the caudate nucleus, where BS mRNA was overexpressed in PD and AS mRNA diminished in PDD. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of dementia in PD, indicating that differential BS and AS expression in the caudate nucleus may represent one of the molecular mechanisms involved in these complex diseases.',\n",
              "  'Assessment of pain and itch behavior in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1. UNLABELLED: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is characterized primarily by tumor formation in the nervous system, but patients report other neurological complications including pain and itch. Individuals with NF1 harbor 1 mutated NF1 allele causing heterozygous expression in all of their cells. In mice, Nf1 heterozygosity leads to hyperexcitability of sensory neurons and hyperproliferation of mast cells, both of which could lead to increased hypersensitivity and scratching in response to noxious and pruritic stimuli. To determine whether Nf1 heterozygosity may increase pain and itch behaviors independent of secondary effects of tumor formation, we used mice with a targeted, heterozygous Nf1 gene deletion (Nf1±) that lack tumors. Nf1± mice exhibited normal baseline responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Moreover, similar to wild-type littermates, Nf1± mice developed inflammation-induced heat\\xa0and mechanical hypersensitivity, capsaicin-induced nocifensive behavior, histamine-dependent or -independent scratching, and chronic constriction injury-induced cold allodynia. However, Nf1±\\xa0mice exhibited an attenuated first phase of formalin-induced spontaneous behavior and expedited resolution of formalin-induced heat hypersensitivity. These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that Nf1 heterozygosity alone is sufficient to increase pain and itch sensation in mice, and they suggest that additional mechanisms may underlie reports of increased pain and itch in NF1 patients. PERSPECTIVE: This study assessed whether Nf1 heterozygosity in mice increased hypersensitivity and scratching following noxious and pruritic stimuli. Using Nf1± mice lacking tumors, this study finds no increases in pain or itch behavior, suggesting that there is no predisposition for either clinical symptom solely due to Nf1 heterozygosity.',\n",
              "  'Initiation of spectrin dimerization involves complementary electrostatic interactions between paired triple-helical bundles. The spectrin heterodimer is formed by the antiparallel lateral association of an alpha and a beta subunit, each of which comprises largely a series of homologous triple-helical motifs. Initiation of dimer assembly involves strong binding between complementary motifs near the actin-binding end of the dimer. In this study, the mechanism of lateral spectrin association at this dimer nucleation site was investigated using the analytical ultracentrifuge to analyze heterodimers formed from recombinant peptides containing two or four homologous motifs from each subunit (alpha20-21/beta1-2; alpha18-21/beta1-4). Both the two-motif and four-motif dimer associations were weakened substantially with increasing salt concentration, indicating that electrostatic interactions are important for the dimer initiation process. Modeling of the electrostatic potential on the surface of the alpha20 and beta2 motifs showed that the side of the motifs comprising the A and B helices is the most favorable for association, with an area of positive electrostatic potential on the AB face of the beta2 motif opposite negative potential on the AB face of the alpha20 motif and vise versa. Protease protection analysis of the alpha20-21/beta1-2 dimer showed that multiple trypsin and proteinase K sites in the A helices of the beta2 and alpha21 motifs become buried upon dimer formation. Together, these data support a model where complementary long range electrostatic interactions on the AB faces of the triple-helical motifs in the dimer nucleation site initiate the correct pairing of motifs, i.e. alpha21-beta1 and alpha20-beta2. After initial docking of these complementary triple-helical motifs, this association is probably stabilized by subsequent formation of stronger hydrophobic interactions in a complex involving the A helices of both subunits and possibly most of the AB faces. The beta subunit A helix in particular appears to be buried in the dimer interface.',\n",
              "  'Acute migraine therapy: new drugs and new approaches. The conceptual shift of our understanding of migraine from a vascular disorder to a brain disorder has dramatically altered the approach to the development of new medicines in the field. Current pharmacologic treatments of acute migraine consist of nonspecific and relatively specific agents. Migraine-specific drugs comprise two classes, the ergot alkaloid derivatives and the triptans, serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists. The ergots, consisting of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (DHE), are the oldest specific antimigraine drugs available and are considered relatively safe and effective. Ergotamine has been used less extensively because of its adverse effects; DHE is better tolerated. The triptan era, beginning in the 1990s, was a period of considerable change, although these medicines retained vasoconstrictor actions. New methods of delivering older drugs include orally inhaled DHE and the transdermal formulation of sumatriptan, both currently under study. Novel medicines being developed are targeted at neural sites of action. Serotonin 5-HT(1F) receptor agonists have proven effective in phase II studies and have no vascular actions. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists are another promising nonvasoconstrictor approach to treating acute migraine. Olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) and telcagepant (MK-0974) have been shown to be safe and effective in phase I, II, and (for telcagepant) phase III clinical trials. Other targets under investigation include glutamate (AMPA/kainate), TRPV1, prostanoid EP4, and nitric oxide synthase. With new neural targets and the potential for therapeutic advances, the next era of antimigraine medications is near.',\n",
              "  'Specific isoforms of p73 control the induction of cell death induced by the viral proteins, E1A or apoptin. A member of the p53 family, p73, has several isoforms and differentially regulates transcription of genes involved in the control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. We have previously shown efficient and p53-independent, tumor-specific cell death induced by the viral proteins E1A and Apoptin. Here, we demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis by these viral proteins involves activation of TAp73. Both E1A and Apoptin induced expression of endogenous TAp73 and the p53/p73 BH3-only pro-apoptotic target, PUMA, independently of the p53 function. Furthermore, exogenous expression of TAp73 isoforms, particularly TAp73beta, sensitized cells to killing by both E1A and Apoptin, while expression of DeltaNp73alpha blocked this activity. Besides, knockout of the p73 regulator, c-Abl, attenuated E1A-induced apoptosis. In accordance with the role of p73 in apoptosis induced by these viral proteins, overexpression of TAp73beta strongly induced apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells in vitro and in HNSCC xenografts. Using a doxycycline-inducible system, we provide evidence for target selectivity and significant differences in protein stability for specific p73 isoforms, suggesting a diverse and pivotal role for p73 in response to various genotoxic agents. Collectively, our data show that in the absence of the p53 function, viral proteins E1A and Apoptin utilize the p73 pathway to induce efficient tumor cell death.',\n",

Ataxin-3 is a ubiquitously expressed deubiqutinating enzyme with important functions in the proteasomal protein degradation pathway and regulation of transcription. The C-terminus of the ataxin-3 protein contains a polyglutamine (PolyQ) region that, when mutationally expanded to over 52 glutamines, causes the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3). In spite of extensive research, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular toxicity resulting from mutant ataxin-3 remain elusive and no preventive treatment is currently available. It has become clear over the last decade that the hallmark intracellular ataxin-3 aggregates are likely not the main toxic entity in SCA3. Instead, the soluble PolyQ containing fragments arising from proteolytic cleavage of ataxin-3 by caspases and calpains are now regarded to be of greater influence in pathogenesis. In addition, recent evidence suggests potential involvement of a RNA toxicity component in SCA3 and other PolyQ expansion disorders, increasing the pathogenic complexity. Herein, we review the functioning of ataxin-3 and the involvement of known protein and RNA toxicity mechanisms of mutant ataxin-3 that have been discovered, as well as future opportunities for therapeutic intervention.',\n",
              "  'Heme mediates derepression of Maf recognition element through direct binding to transcription repressor Bach1. Heme controls expression of genes involved in the synthesis of globins and heme. The mammalian transcription factor Bach1 functions as a repressor of the Maf recognition element (MARE) by forming antagonizing hetero-oligomers with the small Maf family proteins. We show here that heme binds specifically to Bach1 and regulates its DNA-binding activity. Deletion studies demonstrated that a heme-binding region of Bach1 is confined within its C-terminal region that possesses four dipeptide cysteine-proline (CP) motifs. Mutations in all of the CP motifs of Bach1 abolished its interaction with heme. The DNA-binding activity of Bach1 as a MafK hetero-oligomer was markedly inhibited by heme in gel mobility shift assays. The repressor activity of Bach1 was lost upon addition of hemin in transfected cells. These results suggest that increased levels of heme inactivate the repressor Bach1, resulting in induction of a host of genes with MARES:',\n",

Telcagepant is a novel, orally active, and selective calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist being developed for acute treatment of migraine with and without aura. Three separate clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of telcagepant following single oral doses in healthy young and elderly men and women and multiple oral doses in men. Telcagepant was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum concentration of approximately 1.5 hours. The terminal half-life was approximately 6 hours. A greater than dose-proportional increase was observed in the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity. Following twice-daily dosing, with each dose separated by 2 hours, steady state was achieved in approximately 3 to 4 days with an accumulation ratio of approximately 2. There were no clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic differences when compared across age and gender. Telcagepant was generally well tolerated up to single doses of 1200 mg and multiple doses of 400 mg twice daily.',\n",
              "  \"APOBEC3B and AID have similar nuclear import mechanisms. Members of the APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) protein family catalyze DNA cytosine deamination and underpin a variety of immune defenses. For instance, several family members, including APOBEC3B (A3B), elicit strong retrotransposon and retrovirus restriction activities. However, unlike the other proteins, A3B is the only family member with steady-state nuclear localization. Here, we show that A3B nuclear import is an active process requiring at least one amino acid (Val54) within an N-terminal motif analogous to the nuclear localization determinant of the antibody gene diversification enzyme AID (activation-induced cytosine deaminase). Mechanistic conservation with AID is further suggested by A3B's capacity to interact with the same subset of importin proteins. Despite these mechanistic similarities, enforced A3B expression cannot substitute for AID-dependent antibody gene diversification by class switch recombination. Regulatory differences between A3B and AID are also visible during cell cycle progression. Our studies suggest that the present-day A3B enzyme retained the nuclear import mechanism of an ancestral AID protein during the expansion of the APOBEC3 locus in primates. Our studies also highlight the likelihood that, after nuclear import, specialized mechanisms exist to guide these enzymes to their respective physiological substrates and prevent gratuitous chromosomal DNA damage.\",\n",

INTRODUCTION: Ultrasonic measurements of urinary bladders are suitable to quantify bladder wall hypertrophy due to bladder outlet obstruction, detrusor overactivity, or neurogenic bladder dysfunction in adult men or women and in children. Quantification of bladder wall hypertrophy seems to be useful for the assessment of diseases, prediction of treatment outcomes, and longitudinal studies investigating disease development and progression. MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES: Four distinct measurement techniques have been published using bladder wall thickness (BWT), detrusor wall thickness (DWT), or ultrasound-estimated bladder weight (UEBW) assessed by suprapubic or transvaginal positioning of ultrasound probes and different bladder filling volumes. As a result, different threshold and reference values were established causing confusion. This ICI-RS report summarizes the agreements of different research groups in terms of ultrasonic BWT or DWT measurements, critically discusses the four ultrasonic measurement techniques, suggests criteria for quality control, and proposes future research activities to unify measurement strategies. PROPOSED STANDARDIZATION AND RESEARCH: For quality control, all future reports should provide information about frequency of the ultrasound probe, bladder filling volume at measurement, if BWT, DWT, or UEBW was measured, enlargement factor of the ultrasound image, and one ultrasound image with marker positioning. The ICI-RS intends to found a standardization committee that will initiate and judge studies on ultrasonic bladder wall measurements to clarify the most suitable, most accurate, and least invasive measurement technique.',\n",
              "  'Expression of DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalities such as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, developmental abnormality of fin muscle, disorganization of facial musculature and/or degeneration of trunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant localization of myogenic cells marked with α-actin promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside somite boundary, especially in head region. These abnormalities were rescued by coinjection of the short form of DUX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, even at extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FSHD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also propose that DUX4 expression during development is important for the pathogenesis of FSHD.',\n",

              "  'The p73 tumor suppressor is targeted by Pirh2 RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase for the proteasome-dependent degradation. The p73 gene, a homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. TAp73 has similar activity as p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor whereas ΔNp73 has both pro- and anti-survival functions. While p73 is rarely mutated in spontaneous tumors, the expression status of p73 is linked to the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy and prognosis for many types of human cancer. Thus, uncovering its regulators in tumors is of great interest. Here, we found that Pirh2, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of p73. Specifically, we showed that knockdown of Pirh2 up-regulates, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 down-regulates, expression of endogenous and exogenous p73. In addition, Pirh2 physically associates with and promotes TAp73 polyubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we found that p73 can be degraded by both 20 S and 26 S proteasomes. Finally, we showed that Pirh2 knockdown leads to growth suppression in a TAp73-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings indicate that Pirh2 promotes the proteasomal turnover of TAp73, and thus targeting Pirh2 to restore TAp73-mediated growth suppression in p53-deficient tumors may be developed as a novel anti-cancer strategy.',\n",
              "  \"The stratum corneum: the rampart of the mammalian body. BACKGROUND: The stratum corneum (SC) is the outermost region of the epidermis and plays key roles in cutaneous barrier function in mammals. The SC is composed of 'bricks', represented by flattened, protein-enriched corneocytes, and 'mortar', represented by intercellular lipid-enriched layers. As a result of this 'bricks and mortar' structure, the SC can be considered as a 'rampart' that encloses water and solutes essential for physiological homeostasis and that protects mammals from physical, chemical and biological assaults. STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS: The corneocyte cytoskeleton contains tight bundles of keratin intermediate filaments aggregated with filaggrin monomers, which are subsequently degraded into natural moisturizing compounds by various proteases, including caspase 14. A cornified cell envelope is formed on the inner surface of the corneocyte plasma membrane by transglutaminase-catalysed cross-linking of involucrin and loricrin. Ceramides form a lipid envelope by covalently binding to the cornified cell envelope, and extracellular lamellar lipids play an important role in permeability barrier function. Corneodesmosomes are the main adhesive structures in the SC and are degraded by certain serine proteases, such as kallikreins, during desquamation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The roles of the different SC components, including the structural proteins in corneocytes, extracellular lipids and some proteins associated with lipid metabolism, have been investigated in genetically engineered mice and in naturally occurring hereditary skin diseases, such as ichthyosis, ichthyosis syndrome and atopic dermatitis in humans, cattle and dogs.\",\n",

              "  'Small heat shock protein 20 interacts with protein phosphatase-1 and enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling. BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are known to enhance cell survival under various stress conditions. In the heart, the small Hsp20 has emerged as a key mediator of protection against apoptosis, remodeling, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover, Hsp20 has been implicated in modulation of cardiac contractility ex vivo. The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo role of Hsp20 in the heart and the mechanisms underlying its regulatory effects in calcium (Ca) cycling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hsp20 overexpression in intact animals resulted in significant enhancement of cardiac function, coupled with augmented Ca cycling and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load in isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with specific increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at both Ser16 and Thr17, relieving its inhibition of the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a. Accordingly, the inotropic effects of Hsp20 were abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable PLN (S16A/T17A). Interestingly, the activity of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), a known regulator of PLN signaling, was significantly reduced by Hsp20 overexpression, suggesting that the Hsp20 stimulatory effects are partially mediated through the PP1-PLN axis. This hypothesis was supported by cell fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization studies, which revealed an association between Hsp20, PP1, and PLN. Furthermore, recombinant protein studies confirmed a physical interaction between AA 73 to 160 in Hsp20 and AA 163 to 330 in PP1. CONCLUSIONS: Hsp20 is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling by targeting the PP1-PLN axis. These findings, coupled with the well-recognized cardioprotective role of Hsp20, suggest a dual benefit of targeting Hsp20 in heart disease.',\n",

We report the development of OikoBase (http://oikoarrays.biology.uiowa.edu/Oiko/), a tiling array-based genome browser resource for Oikopleura dioica, a metazoan belonging to the urochordates, the closest extant group to vertebrates. OikoBase facilitates retrieval and mining of a variety of useful genomics information. First, it includes a genome browser which interrogates 1260 genomic sequence scaffolds and features gene, transcript and CDS annotation tracks. Second, we annotated gene models with gene ontology (GO) terms and InterPro domains which are directly accessible in the browser with links to their entries in the GO (http://www.geneontology.org/) and InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) databases, and we provide transcript and peptide links for sequence downloads. Third, we introduce the transcriptomics of a comprehensive set of developmental stages of O. dioica at high resolution and provide downloadable gene expression data for all developmental stages. Fourth, we incorporate a BLAST tool to identify homologs of genes and proteins. Finally, we include a tutorial that describes how to use OikoBase as well as a link to detailed methods, explaining the data generation and analysis pipeline. OikoBase will provide a valuable resource for research in chordate development, genome evolution and plasticity and the molecular ecology of this important marine planktonic organism.',\n",
              "  'Novel anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current clinical evidence and future developments. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac rhythm disorder and a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. Antithrombotic therapy using aspirin or vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is currently prescribed for prevention for ischemic stroke in patients with AF. A narrow therapeutic range and the need of regular monitoring of its anticoagulatory effect impair effectiveness and safety of VKA, causing a need for alternative anticoagulant drugs. Recently developed anticoagulants include direct thrombin antagonists such as dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, and edoxaban. Currently, data from a phase III clinical trial are available for dabigatran only, which show the direct thrombin antagonist to be at least noninferior in efficacy to VKA for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF. This review focuses on current advances in the development of directly acting oral anticoagulant drugs and their potential to replace the VKA class of drugs in patients with AF.',\n",
              "  'Phase 1 trial of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Proteasome inhibitors, a novel class of chemotherapeutic agents, enhance the antitumor efficacy of anthracyclines in vitro and in vivo. We therefore sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PegLD). Bortezomib was given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 from 0.90 to 1.50 mg/m2 and PegLD on day 4 at 30 mg/m2 to 42 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in at least 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, pneumonia, peripheral neuropathy, febrile neutropenia, and diarrhea. The MTD based on cycle 1 was 1.50 and 30 mg/m2 of bortezomib and PegLD, respectively. However, due to frequent dose reductions and delays at this level, 1.30 and 30 mg/m2 are recommended for further study. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies did not find significant drug interactions between these agents. Antitumor activity was seen against multiple myeloma, with 8 of 22 evaluable patients having a complete response (CR) or near-CR, including several with anthracycline-refractory disease, and another 8 having partial responses (PRs). One patient with relapsed/refractory T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) achieved a CR, whereas 2 patients each with acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell NHL had PRs. Bortezomib/PegLD was safely administered in this study with promising antitumor activity, supporting further testing of this regimen.',\n",
              "  'Early onset HER2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline TP53 mutations. BACKGROUND: Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with TP53 mutations is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who underwent genetic testing for suspected germline TP53 mutations and who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011. The pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation (cases) were compared with those testing negative (controls). RESULTS: Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). Among patients with a mutation, 70% had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the control group (P = .87). After adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, having a HER2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a germline TP53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). For each yearly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a TP53 mutation of 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. If confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating HER2-targeted therapies, and elucidate some of the molecular pathways involved in breast cancer.',\n",
              "  'Breast cancer phenotype in women with TP53 germline mutations: a Li-Fraumeni syndrome consortium effort. Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), an inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Their lifetime breast cancer risk is 49% by age 60. Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series. We seek to complement the existing small literature with this report of a histopathologic analysis of breast cancers from women with documented LFS. Unstained slides and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from breast cancers from 39 germline TP53 mutation carriers were assembled from investigators in the LFS consortium. Central histology review was performed on 93% of the specimens by a single breast pathologist from a major university hospital. Histology, grade, and hormone receptor status were assessed by immunohistochemistry; HER-2 status was defined by immunohistochemistry and/or FISH. The 43 tumors from 39 women comprise 32 invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). No other histologies were observed. The median age at diagnosis was 32\\xa0years (range 22-46). Of the invasive cancers, 84% were positive for ER and/or PR; and 81% were high grade. Sixty three percent of invasive and 73% of in situ carcinomas were positive for Her2/neu (IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). Of the invasive tumors, 53% were positive for both ER and HER2+; other ER/PR/HER2 combinations were observed. The DCIS were positive for ER and HER2 in 27% of the cases. This report of the phenotype of breast cancers from women with LFS nearly doubles the literature on this topic. Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive. These findings suggest that modern treatments may result in improved outcomes for women with LFS-associated breast cancer.',\n",
              "  'Complete OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiency causes human Rotor syndrome by interrupting conjugated bilirubin reuptake into the liver. Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within liver lobules, this shuttle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.',\n",
              "  'Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) transcript: A-to-I editing events in normal and cancerous human keratinocytes. Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) are the most common malignancies in caucasians worldwide. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) was suggested to function as a tumor suppressor gene in several cancers, and to play a role in the proliferation of keratinocytes. A-to-I RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism frequently used to expand and diversify transcriptome and proteome repertoire in eukaryotic cells. A-to-I RNA editing can alter codons, substitute amino acids and affect protein sequence, structure, and function. Two editing sites were identified within the IGFBP7 transcript. To evaluate the expression and editing of IGFBP7 mRNA in NMSC compared to normal epidermis. We examined the expression and mRNA editing level of IGFBP7 in 22 basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 15 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 18 normal epidermis samples that were surgically removed from patients by the Mohs Micrographic Surgery procedure. We studied the effect of IGFBP7 editing on an immortalized HaCaT keratinocyte cell model. IGFBP7 mRNA is over expressed in BCC and SCC compared to normal epidermis. Moreover, the IGFBP7 transcript is highly edited in normal epidermis, but its editing is significantly reduced in BCC and SCC. The edited form of IGFBP7 can inhibit proliferation and induce senescence in cultured keratinocytes. This study describes for the first time A-to-I editing in the coding sequence of a tumor suppressor gene in humans, and suggests that IGFBP7 editing serves as a fine-tuning mechanism to maintain the equilibrium between proliferation and senescence in normal skin.',\n",
              "  'Oligomeric interactions between phospholamban molecules regulate Ca-ATPase activity in functionally reconstituted membranes. Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of Ca-ATPase transport activity. To identify whether oligomeric interactions between PLB molecules are involved in regulating Ca-ATPase transport activity, we have investigated functional interactions between PLB and the Ca-ATPase in proteoliposomes of purified PLB functionally co-reconstituted with the SERCA2a isoform of the Ca-ATPase isolated from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The calcium sensitivity of this reconstituted preparation and functional stimulation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are virtually identical to those of the Ca-ATPase in cardiac SR microsomes, ensuring the functional relevance of this reconstituted preparation. Interactions between PLB molecules were measured following covalent modification of the single lysine (i.e., Lys(3)) in PLB isolated from cardiac SR membranes with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) prior to co-reconstitution with the Ca-ATPase. FITC modification of PLB does not interfere with the ability of PLB to inhibit the Ca-ATPase, since FITC-PLB co-reconstituted with the Ca-ATPase exhibits a similar calcium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation to that observed in native SR membranes. Thus, the functional arrangement of PLB with the Ca-ATPase is not modified by FITC modification. Using changes in the anisotropy of FITC-PLB resulting from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between proximal PLB molecules to measure the average size and spatial arrangement of FITC chromophores, we find that PLB self-associates to form oligomers whose spatial arrangement with respect to one another is in agreement with earlier suggestions that PLB exists predominantly as a homopentamer. The inability of PKA to activate PLB following covalent modification with FITC permits functional interactions between PLB molecules associated with the Ca-ATPase activation to be identified. A second-order loss of Ca-ATPase activation by PKA is observed as a function of the fractional contribution of FITC-PLB, indicating that PKA-dependent activation of two PLB molecules within a quaternary complex containing the Ca-ATPase is necessary for activation of the Ca-ATPase. We suggest that the requirement for activation of two PLB molecules by PKA represents a physiological mechanism to ensure that activation of the Ca-ATPase following beta-adrenergic stimulation in the heart only occurs above a threshold level of PKA activation.',\n",
              "  'Opicapone: a short lived and very long acting novel catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor following multiple dose administration in healthy subjects. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and inhibitory effect on erythrocyte soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT) activity following repeated doses of opicapone. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study enrolled healthy male subjects who received either once daily placebo or opicapone 5, 10, 20 or 30 mg for 8 days. RESULTS: Opicapone was well tolerated. Its systemic exposure increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner with an apparent terminal half-life of 1.0 to 1.4 h. Sulphation was the main metabolic pathway. Opicapone metabolites recovered in urine accounted for less than 3% of the amount of opicapone administered suggesting that bile is likely the main route of excretion. Maximum S-COMT inhibition (Emax ) ranged from 69.9% to 98.0% following the last dose of opicapone. The opicapone-induced S-COMT inhibition showed a half-life in excess of 100 h, which was dose-independent and much longer than plasma drug exposure. Such a half-life translates into a putative underlying rate constant that is comparable with the estimated dissociation rate constant of the COMT-opicapone complex. CONCLUSION: Despite its short elimination half-life, opicapone markedly and sustainably inhibited erythrocyte S-COMT activity making it suitable for a once daily regimen.',\n",
              "  'S phase-dependent interaction with DNMT1 dictates the role of UHRF1 but not UHRF2 in DNA methylation maintenance. Recent studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is required for DNA methylation maintenance by targeting DNMT1 to DNA replication foci, presumably through its unique hemi-methylated DNA-binding activity and interaction with DNMT1. UHRF2, another member of the UHRF family proteins, is highly similar to UHRF1 in both sequence and structure, raising questions about its role in DNA methylation. In this study, we demonstrate that, like UHRF1, UHRF2 also binds preferentially to methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) through its conserved tudor domain and hemi-methylated DNA through the SET and Ring associated domain. Like UHRF1, UHRF2 is enriched in pericentric heterochromatin. The heterochromatin localization depends to large extent on its methylated H3K9-binding activity and to less extent on its methylated DNA-binding activity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that both UHRF1 and UHRF2 interact with DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b and G9a. Despite all these conserved functions, we find that UHRF2 is not able to rescue the DNA methylation defect in Uhrf1 null mouse embryonic stem cells. This can be attributed to the inability for UHRF2 to recruit DNMT1 to replication foci during S phase of the cell cycle. Indeed, we find that while UHRF1 interacts with DNMT1 in an S phase-dependent manner in cells, UHRF2 does not. Thus, our study demonstrates that UHRF2 and UHRF1 are not functionally redundant in DNA methylation maintenance and reveals the cell-cycle-dependent interaction between UHRF1 and DNMT1 as a key regulatory mechanism targeting DNMT1 for DNA methylation.',\n",
              "  'Genetic causes of goiter and deafness: Pendred syndrome in a girl and cooccurrence of Pendred syndrome and resistance to thyroid hormone in her sister. CONTEXT: Goiter and deafness can be associated in some genetic syndromes, e.g. Pendred syndrome (PS) and resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH). PS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by goiter and sensorineural hearing impairment with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct bilaterally. RTH is an autosomal dominant condition of reduced tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormone in which goiter is very frequent and hearing loss occurs in about 20% of patients. OBJECTIVE, PATIENTS, AND DESIGN: The objective of this study was to identify the cause of goiter and deafness in two sisters born to healthy unrelated parents. We present their history, clinical presentation, and follow-up and report the results of molecular genetic investigations. RESULTS: The elder sister had an elevated TSH level at newborn screening followed by subclinical hypothyroidism, childhood-onset goiter, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts, consistent with a diagnosis of PS. Her younger sister had congenital goiter, elevated free T3 and free T4 concentrations with unsuppressed TSH, sinus tachycardia, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts. This clinical presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of RTH, in which, however, inner ear malformations are uncommon. Interestingly, molecular genetic testing showed that, whereas the elder sister is affected by PS, the younger sister has both PS (due to compound heterozygous SLC26A4 mutations) and RTH (due to a novel de novo heterozygous THRB mutation). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the cooccurrence, in the same individual, of PS and RTH, two genetic syndromes both associated with goiter and hearing impairment.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and provide practical information for patient management. DATA SOURCES: Literature was retrieved from PubMed (2000-January 2011), using the search terms chronic myeloid leukemia and tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Abstracts presented at the 2008-2010 annual meetings of the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, reference citations from identified publications, as well as the manufacturers' full prescribing information for cited drugs, also were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating the efficacy and safety of the TKIs imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib were evaluated. Focus was placed on publications supporting management of patients with CML in the chronic phase. Reports presenting clinical trial information of TKIs in development also were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: The discovery of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase dramatically changed the treatment of CML. Imatinib, the first TKI approved for treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome--positive CML, demonstrated significant superiority over the previous standard of care: interferon plus cytarabine. The newer, more potent TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, have demonstrated improved efficacy over imatinib as first-line therapy and provide an effective option for patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize efficacy of TKI therapy, close patient management, involving frequent monitoring of patient response, is essential. Given the importance of continuing TKI therapy, early recognition and management of adverse events are critical to optimizing outcomes in patients with CML. In addition to the safety profile and considerations of comorbidities, additional factors can affect therapeutic selection, including drug-drug and drug-food interactions. Research investigating new therapies, particularly for patients harboring the T315I mutation-which remains refractory to current TKIs-continues in the quest to improve outcomes in patients with CML.\",\n",
              "  'Colocalization of tau and alpha-synuclein epitopes in Lewy bodies. The major protein constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, is considered to be alpha-synuclein, but other proteins, in particular the microtubule-associated protein tau, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LBs. Tau is the major structural component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Both direct immunochemical studies of partially purified LBs and indirect immunohistochemical studies have suggested that LBs may contain tau, but most of these studies were based upon a single tau antibody, and immunologic cross-reactivity was not completely excluded. To gain insight into the relation between tau and alpha-synuclein in LBs, double immunostaining was performed in Lewy body cases with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to alpha-synuclein and a panel of monoclonal antibodies to phospho- and nonphospho-tau epitopes (Alz50, CP9, CP13, PG5, TG3, PHFI) that spanned the length of the tau molecule. Tau-immunoreactive LBs were present in the medulla in 80% of the cases, irrespective of Braak stage. All tau antibodies recognized at least some LBs, arguing against nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity. In most lesions the tau immunostaining was present at the periphery of the LB. The phospho-tau antibody, TG3, detected more LBs than any of the other tau antibodies. The proportion of LBs with tau immunoreactivity was greatest in neurons vulnerable to NETs, such as those in the locus ceruleus and basal nucleus of Meynert, and least in neurons resistant to NFTs, such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the medulla. The present results suggest that tau may coaggregate with alpha-synuclein in LBs, especially in neuronal populations vulnerable to both NFTs and LBs.',\n",
              "  'Progesterone/RANKL is a major regulatory axis in the human breast. Estrogens and progesterones are major drivers of breast development but also promote carcinogenesis in this organ. Yet, their respective roles and the mechanisms underlying their action in the human breast are unclear. Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) has been identified as a pivotal paracrine mediator of progesterone function in mouse mammary gland development and mammary carcinogenesis. Whether the factor has the same role in humans is of clinical interest because an inhibitor for RANKL, denosumab, is already used for the treatment of bone disease and might benefit breast cancer patients. We show that progesterone receptor (PR) signaling failed to induce RANKL in PR(+) breast cancer cell lines and in dissociated, cultured breast epithelial cells. In clinical specimens from healthy donors and intact breast tissue microstructures, hormone response was maintained and RANKL expression was under progesterone control, which increased RNA stability. RANKL was sufficient to trigger cell proliferation and was required for progesterone-induced proliferation. The findings were validated in vivo where RANKL protein expression in the breast epithelium correlated with serum progesterone levels and the protein was expressed in a subset of luminal cells that express PR. Thus, important hormonal control mechanisms are conserved across species, making RANKL a potential target in breast cancer treatment and prevention.',\n",
              "  'Inhibition of T-type calcium channels and hydrogen sulfide-forming enzyme reverses paclitaxel-evoked neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats. Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S), a gasotransmitter, facilitates pain sensation by targeting Ca(v)3.2 T-type calcium channels. The H₂S/Ca(v)3.2 pathway appears to play a role in the maintenance of surgically evoked neuropathic pain. Given evidence that chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain is blocked by ethosuximide, known to block T-type calcium channels, we examined if more selective T-type calcium channel blockers and also inhibitors of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), a major H₂S-forming enzyme in the peripheral tissue, are capable of reversing the neuropathic pain evoked by paclitaxel, an anti-cancer drug. It was first demonstrated that T-type calcium channel blockers, NNC 55-0396, known to inhibit Ca(v)3.1, and mibefradil inhibited T-type currents in Ca(v)3.2-transfected HEK293 cells. Repeated systemic administration of paclitaxel caused delayed development of mechanical hyperalgesia, which was reversed by single intraplantar administration of NNC 55-0396 or mibefradil, and by silencing of Ca(v)3.2 by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Systemic administration of dl-propargylglycine and β-cyanoalanine, irreversible and reversible inhibitors of CSE, respectively, also abolished the established neuropathic hyperalgesia. In the paclitaxel-treated rats, upregulation of Ca(v)3.2 and CSE at protein levels was not detected in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal cord or peripheral tissues including the hindpaws, whereas H(2)S content in hindpaw tissues was significantly elevated. Together, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of NNC 55-0396 in inhibiting Ca(v)3.2, and then suggests that paclitaxel-evoked neuropathic pain might involve the enhanced activity of T-type calcium channels and/or CSE in rats, but not upregulation of Ca(v)3.2 and CSE at protein levels, differing from the previous evidence for the neuropathic pain model induced by spinal nerve cutting in which Ca(v)3.2 was dramatically upregulated in DRG.',\n",
              "  'Ryanodine receptor defects in muscle genetic diseases. Ryanodine receptor (RyR), a homotetrameric Ca2+ release channel, is one of the main actors in the generation of Ca2+ signals that trigger muscle contraction. Three genes encode three isoforms of RyRs, which have tissue-restricted distribution. RyR1 and RyR2 are typical of muscle cells, with RyR1 originally considered the skeletal muscle type and RyR2 the cardiac type. However, RyR1 and RyR2 have recently been found in numerous other cell types, including, for instance, peripheral B and T lymphocytes. In contrast, RyR3 is widely distributed among cells. RyR1 and RyR2 are localized in a specialized portion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the terminal cisternae, which is the portion of the SR Ca2+ store that releases Ca2+ to control the process of muscle contraction. A specific role for RyR3 has not yet been established: probably, its co-expression with the other RyR isoforms contributes to qualitatively modulate Ca2+-dependent processes in muscle cells and in neurons. Several mutations in the genes encoding RyR1 and RyR2 have been identified in autosomal dominant diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscle, such as malignant hyperthermia (MH), central core disease (CCD), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2). More recently, CCD cases with recessive inheritance have also been described. MH is a pharmacogenetic disease, but the others manifest as congenital myopathies. Even if their clinical phenotypes are well established, particularly in skeletal muscle, the molecular mechanisms that generate the conditions are not clear. A number of studies on cellular models have attempted to elucidate the molecular defects associated with the different mutations, but the problem of understanding how mutations in the same gene generate such an array of diverse pathological traits and diseases of widely different degrees of severity is still open. This review will consider the molecular and cellular effects of RyR mutations, summarizing recent data in the literature on Ca2+ dysregulation, which may lead to a better understanding of the functioning of RyRs.',\n",
              "  'Multiple roles of ubiquitination in the control of nucleotide excision repair. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a remarkably versatile DNA repair system, essential for maintenance of genomic stability. Hereditary alterations in NER enzymes can result in increased cancer propensity, but also in developmental, neurodegenerative, and progeroid syndromes. NER can be operationally divided in three subtypes, which share many common steps: global genomic repair (GGR) operates on the whole genome level, transcription domain-associated repair (DAR) is a concentration of NER activity within transcription factories, and transcription-coupled repair (TCR) provides faster repair of the transcribed strand of active genes. Interestingly, ubiquitination plays an important role in all three classes of NER, as well as in associated phenomena, such as damage signalling by histone ubiquitination, and degradation of stalled RNA polymerase II when repair does not occur in a timely manner.',\n",
              "  'Spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome. BACKGROUND: Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome with characteristic facial gestalt and mental retardation of variable severity. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene has been implicated as the major cause of Sotos syndrome, with a predominance of microdeletions reported in Japanese patients. This study was conducted to investigate into the spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome. METHODS: Thirty-six Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome and two patients with Weaver syndrome were subject to molecular testing. RESULTS: NSD1 gene mutations were detected in 26 (72%) Sotos patients. Microdeletion was found in only 3 patients, while the other 23 had point mutations (6 frameshift, 8 nonsense, 2 spice site, and 7 missense). Of these, 19 mutations were never reported. NSD1 gene mutations were not found in the two patients with Weaver syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of Sotos syndrome are caused by NSD1 gene defects, but the spectrum of mutations is different from that of Japanese patients. Genotype-phenotype correlation showed that patients with microdeletions might be more prone to congenital heart disease but less likely to have somatic overgrowth. The two patients with Weaver syndrome were not found to have NSD1 gene mutations, but the number was too small for any conclusion to be drawn.',\n",

The Ewing family of tumors harbors chromosomal translocations that join the N-terminal region of the EWS gene with the C-terminal region of several transcription factors of the ETS family, mainly FLI1, resulting in chimeric transcription factors that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Ewing tumors. To identify downstream targets of the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein, we established 293 cells expressing constitutively either the chimeric EWS/FLI1 or wild type FLI1 proteins and used cDNA arrays to identify genes differentially regulated by EWS/FLI1. DAX1 (NR0B1), an unusual orphan nuclear receptor involved in gonadal development, sex determination and steroidogenesis, showed a consistent up-regulation by EWS/FLI1 oncoprotein, but not by wild type FLI1. Specific induction of DAX1 by EWS/FLI1 was confirmed in two independent cell systems with inducible expression of EWS/FLI1. We also analyzed the expression of DAX1 in Ewing tumors and derived cell lines, as well as in other nonrelated small round cell tumors. DAX1 was expressed in all Ewing tumor specimens analyzed, and in seven out of eight Ewing tumor cell lines, but not in any neuroblastoma or embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Furthermore, silencing of EWS/FLI1 by RNA interference in a Ewing tumor cell line markedly reduced the levels of DAX1 mRNA and protein, confirming that DAX1 up-regulation is dependent upon EWS/FLI1 expression. The high levels of DAX1 found in Ewing tumors and its potent transcriptional repressor activity suggest that the oncogenic effect of EWS/FLI1 may be mediated, at least in part, by the up-regulation of DAX1 expression.',\n",
              "  'Costello syndrome and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Costello syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, loose skin, coarse facies, skeletal abnormalities, cardiovascular abnormalities (congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy, rhythm disturbances), and predisposition to neoplasia. Endocrine abnormalities including growth hormone deficiency, adrenal insufficiency, glucose intolerance, parathyroid adenoma with hyperprolactinemia and hypoglycemia have been described. Hypoglycemia has been documented due to growth hormone and cortisol deficiency. We report on two patients with Costello syndrome and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and review the endocrine manifestations of Costello syndrome. Both patients required diazoxide therapy to stop the unregulated insulin secretion and maintain normoglycemia. The mechanism of persistent hyperinsulinism in patients with Costello syndrome is unclear.',\n",
              "  'Expression of cln3 in human NT2 neuronal precursor cells and neonatal rat brain. During brain development, excess neurons that are formed die by apoptosis. cln3 was recently identified as the gene defective in juvenile Batten disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disease of childhood. In this disease, neurons die by apoptosis. Overexpression of this gene increases survival of human NT2 neuronal precursor cells. We, therefore, hypothesized that cln3 may be present in developing neurons and may play an important role in regulating the developmental process. NT2 neuronal cells were induced to develop into mature neurons. We evaluated cln3 expression by reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry over a 7-wk period of differentiation. Also, cln3 expression was characterized in neonatal rat brain during the first week of life (P-1, P0, P4, and P8) and at P30. cln3 was differentially expressed during neuronal development into nondividing post-mitotic neurons. The greatest expression was noted during wk 6 and then dropped to predifferentiation levels during wk 7. cln3 expression was detected in all the rat brain developmental stages evaluated. The greatest expression was seen at P0 and was double compared with the other stages. We conclude that cln3 is present during critical periods of neuronal cell differentiation and brain development. As cln3 is antiapoptotic, we hypothesize that cln3 plays an important role in regulating brain development. These findings may have implications for identifying strategies aimed at neuroprotection and neuronal survival during development.',\n",
              "  'S phase-dependent interaction with DNMT1 dictates the role of UHRF1 but not UHRF2 in DNA methylation maintenance. Recent studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is required for DNA methylation maintenance by targeting DNMT1 to DNA replication foci, presumably through its unique hemi-methylated DNA-binding activity and interaction with DNMT1. UHRF2, another member of the UHRF family proteins, is highly similar to UHRF1 in both sequence and structure, raising questions about its role in DNA methylation. In this study, we demonstrate that, like UHRF1, UHRF2 also binds preferentially to methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) through its conserved tudor domain and hemi-methylated DNA through the SET and Ring associated domain. Like UHRF1, UHRF2 is enriched in pericentric heterochromatin. The heterochromatin localization depends to large extent on its methylated H3K9-binding activity and to less extent on its methylated DNA-binding activity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that both UHRF1 and UHRF2 interact with DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b and G9a. Despite all these conserved functions, we find that UHRF2 is not able to rescue the DNA methylation defect in Uhrf1 null mouse embryonic stem cells. This can be attributed to the inability for UHRF2 to recruit DNMT1 to replication foci during S phase of the cell cycle. Indeed, we find that while UHRF1 interacts with DNMT1 in an S phase-dependent manner in cells, UHRF2 does not. Thus, our study demonstrates that UHRF2 and UHRF1 are not functionally redundant in DNA methylation maintenance and reveals the cell-cycle-dependent interaction between UHRF1 and DNMT1 as a key regulatory mechanism targeting DNMT1 for DNA methylation.',\n",
              "  'Lack of prognostic significance of survivin in pediatric medulloblastoma. Medulloblastoma (MDB) is the most common malignant cerebellar tumor in children. Because of the significant rate of mortality and treatment-related morbidity, the identification of prognostic factors could lead to a more accurate selection of patients who can benefit from a less aggressive therapy and improve risk stratification. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), the expression of which has been associated with worse prognosis in MDB. However, both of its subcellular localizations may contribute to tumor progression, and ultimately, survivin subcellular localization prognostic value depends on tumor type biological features. The goal of this study was to analyze these survivin features in the pediatric MDB tumor samples and its impact on clinical outcome. Survivin expression and subcellular localization were accessed by immunohistochemistry in a series of 41 tumor samples. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Survivin expression ranged from completely absent to fully present in a notably higher pattern of nuclear localization than cytoplasmic (19 of 41 versus 4 of 41, respectively). However, survivin expression and subcellular localization were not associated with five-year overall survival or metastasis status at diagnosis, which was the only statistically significant prognostic factor in our series (p = 0.008). Taken together, our results suggest that survivin expression should be further studied in large, multicenter series to determine its accurate impact on prognosis and pathobiology of pediatric MDB.',\n",
              "  \"Mechanism of histone methylation catalyzed by protein lysine methyltransferase SET7/9 and origin of product specificity. Methylation of certain lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of core histone proteins in nucleosome is of fundamental importance in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Such histone modification is catalyzed by protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs). PKMTs contain a conserved SET domain in almost all of the cases and may transfer one to three methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the epsilon-amino group of the target lysine residue. Here, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics and free-energy simulations are performed on human PKMT SET7/9 and its mutants to understand two outstanding questions for the reaction catalyzed by PKMTs: the mechanism for deprotonation of positively charged methyl lysine (lysine) and origin of product specificity. The results of the simulations suggest that Tyr-335 (an absolute conserved residue in PKMTs) may play the role as the general base for the deprotonation after dissociation of AdoHcy (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine) and before binding of AdoMet. It is shown that conformational changes could bring Y335 to the target methyl lysine (lysine) for proton abstraction. This mechanism provides an explanation why methyl transfers could be catalyzed by PKMTs processively. The free-energy profiles for methyl transfers are reported and analyzed for wild type and certain mutants (Y305F and Y335F) and the active-site interactions that are of importance for the enzyme's function are discussed. The results of the simulations provide important insights into the catalytic process and lead to a better understanding of experimental observations concerning the origin of product specificity for PKMTs.\",\n",
              "  'Delamanid for multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. BACKGROUND: Delamanid (OPC-67683), a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative, is a new antituberculosis medication that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis and has shown potent in vitro and in vivo activity against drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial, we assigned 481 patients (nearly all of whom were negative for the human immunodeficiency virus) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to receive delamanid, at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (161 patients) or 200 mg twice daily (160 patients), or placebo (160 patients) for 2 months in combination with a background drug regimen developed according to World Health Organization guidelines. Sputum cultures were assessed weekly with the use of both liquid broth and solid medium; sputum-culture conversion was defined as a series of five or more consecutive cultures that were negative for growth of M. tuberculosis. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth medium at 2 months. RESULTS: Among patients who received a background drug regimen plus 100 mg of delamanid twice daily, 45.4% had sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth at 2 months, as compared with 29.6% of patients who received a background drug regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compared with the placebo group, the group that received the background drug regimen plus 200 mg of delamanid twice daily had a higher proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment of sputum-culture conversion in solid medium. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were evenly distributed across groups. Although no clinical events due to QT prolongation on electrocardiography were observed, QT prolongation was reported significantly more frequently in the groups that received delamanid. CONCLUSIONS: Delamanid was associated with an increase in sputum-culture conversion at 2 months among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. This finding suggests that delamanid could enhance treatment options for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

              "  \"[Chemotherapy-free treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia?]. Treatment of CLL patients with conventional cytotoxic agents is often combined with significant toxicity that prevents broad application especially in elderly patients. In addition, relapse frequently occurs after application of conventional chemotherapy in CLL. Recently several new chemo-free treatment options have been introduced within clinical trials. Among them are monoclonal antibodies, most of them targeting the CD20 molecule: besides the licensed drugs rituximab and ofatumumab obinutuzumab, although in combination with chemotherapy, has recently shown high clinical efficacy in front-line treatment of elderly patients with CLL. Lenalidomide as monotherapy has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with relapsed disease and first data within clinical trials have been generated in the front-line setting. A promising class of novel agents has been designed to block aberrant signaling from the B-cell receptor. Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform. Another class of drugs with potential impact for chemo-free treatment strategies in CLL are the BH3-mimetic inhibitors of the Bcl-2 family of pro-survival proteins. Other interesting candidate drugs that are currently explored for CLL patients include small modular immunopharmaceutical (SMIP) proteins (e. g. TRU-016), CDK inhibitors (e. g. dinaciclib), HDAC inhibitors and others. Given all these novel agents and targets, chemo-free or at least chemo-reduced concepts may become reality in the near future for our patients suffering from CLL.\",\n",
              "  'Interactions of ataxin-3 with its molecular partners in the protein machinery that sorts protein aggregates to the aggresome. Ataxin-3 (AT3) is the protein that triggers the inherited neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 when its polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch close to the C-terminus exceeds a critical length. AT3 consists of the N-terminal globular Josephin domain (JD) and the C-terminal disordered one. It cleaves isopeptide bonds between ubiquitin monomers, an event involved in protein quality control mechanisms. AT3 has been implicated in the pathway that sorts aggregated protein to aggresomes via microtubules, in which dynein and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) also seem to be involved. By taking advantage of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we have investigated the interaction of AT3 with tubulin and HDAC6. Based on SAXS results, the AT3 oligomer, consisting of 6-7 subunits, tightly binds to the tubulin hexameric oligomer in a \"parallel\" fashion. By SPR analysis we have demonstrated that AT3 binds to tubulin dimer with a 50nM affinity. Binding fits with a Langmuir 1:1 model and involves a single binding interface. Nevertheless, the interaction surface consists of three distinct, discontinuous tubulin-binding regions (TBR), one located in the JD, and the two others in the disordered domain, upstream and downstream of the polyQ stretch. In the absence of any of the three TBRs, the affinity is drastically reduced. By SPR we have also provided the first evidence of direct binding of AT3 to HDAC6, with affinity in the range 0.1-1μM. These results shed light on the interactions among the components of the transport machinery that sorts aggregate protein to the aggresome, and pave the way to in vivo studies aimed at further clarifying their roles.',\n",
              "  'Zinc mesoporphyrin induces rapid and marked degradation of the transcription factor Bach1 and up-regulates HO-1. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is the first and rate-controlling enzyme in heme degradation. Bach1 is a mammalian transcriptional repressor of HO-1. To understand how zinc mesoporphyrin (ZnMP) induces the expression of HO-1, we investigated the effects of ZnMP on Bach1 mRNA and protein levels in human hepatoma Huh-7 cells by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blots. We found that ZnMP markedly up-regulated HO-1 mRNA and protein levels, and rapidly and significantly decreased Bach1 protein levels by increasing degradation of Bach1 protein [half life (t(1/2)) from 19 h to 45 min], whereas ZnMP did not influence Bach1 mRNA levels. The proteasome inhibitors, epoxomicin and MG132, significantly inhibited degradation of Bach1 by ZnMP in a dose-dependent fashion, indicating that the degradation of Bach1 by ZnMP is proteasome-dependent. Purified Bach1 C-terminal fragment bound heme, but there was no evidence for binding of ZnMP to the heme-binding region of Bach1. In conclusion, ZnMP produces profound post-transcriptional down-regulation of Bach1 protein levels and transcriptional up-regulation of HO-1. Our results indicate that ZnMP up-regulates HO-1 gene expression by markedly increasing Bach1 protein degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner.',\n",
              "  'Over-expression of CLN3P, the Batten disease protein, inhibits PANDER-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells: further evidence that CLN3P has anti-apoptotic properties. Juvenile neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (JNCL) or Batten/Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjogren disease (OMIM #204200) is one of a group of nine clinically related inherited neurodegenerative disorders (CLN1-9). JNCL results from mutations in CLN3 on chromosome 16p12.1. The neuronal loss in Batten disease has been shown to be due to a combination of apoptosis and autophagy suggesting that CLN3P, the defective protein, may have an anti-neuronal death function. PANDER (PANcreatic-DERived factor) is a novel cytokine that was recently cloned from pancreatic islet cells. PANDER is specifically expressed in the pancreatic islets, small intestine, testis, prostate, and neurons of the central nervous system, and has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis. In this study, we over-expressed CLN3P in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and monitored the effects on PANDER-induced apoptosis. CLN3P significantly increased the survival rate of the SH-SY5Y cells in this system. This study provides additional evidence that the function of CLN3P is related to preventing neuronal apoptosis.',\n",
              "  'The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-mediated Ca2+ influx triggers nitric oxide-induced cytotoxicity in cultured astrocytes. Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulating kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, leading to caspase-independent apoptosis in cultured astrocytes. In view of the previous observation that NO stimulates the activity of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), this study examines the involvement of NCX in cytotoxicity. The specific NCX inhibitor SEA0400 blocked SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, and decrease in cell viability. SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK was blocked by removal of external Ca(2+), and SNP treatment caused an increase in (45)Ca(2+) influx. This increase in (45)Ca(2+) influx was blocked by SEA0400, but not the Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine. In addition, SNP-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx and cytotoxicity were reduced in NCX1-deficient cells which were transfected with NCX1 siRNA. Inhibitors of intracellular Ca(2+)-dependent proteins such as calpain and calmodulin blocked SNP-induced ERK phosphorylation and decrease in cell viability. Furthermore, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor LY83583 and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT5823 blocked SNP-induced cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that NCX-mediated Ca(2+) influx triggers SNP-induced apoptosis in astrocytes, which may be mediated by a cGMP-dependent pathway.',\n",
              "  'Structural ramification for acetyl-lysine recognition by the bromodomain of human BRG1 protein, a central ATPase of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex. Bromodomains represent an extensive family of evolutionarily conserved domains that are found in many chromatin-associated proteins such as histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and subunits of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes. These domains are associated with acetylated lysine residues that bind both in vivo and in vitro; for example, they bind to the N-acetylated lysines of the histone tail of nucleosomes. In this report, we determined the structure of the bromodomain from human brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) protein, a subunit of an ATP-dependent switching/sucrose nonfermenting (SWI/SNF) remodeling complex, and have also characterized its in vitro interaction with N-acetylated lysine peptides from histones. In addition to a typical all-alpha-helical fold that was observed in the bromodomains, we observed for the first time a small beta-sheet in the ZA loop region of the BRG1 protein. The BRG1 bromodomain exhibited binding, albeit weak, to acetylated peptides that were derived from histones H3 and H4. We have compared the acetyl-lysine binding sites of BRG1 bromodomain with the yGCN5 (general control of amino acid biosynthesis). By modeling the acetylated-lysine peptide into the BRG1 bromodomain structure, we were able to explain the weak binding of acetylated-lysine peptides to this bromodomain.',\n",
              "  'SERCA2a superinhibition by human phospholamban triggers electrical and structural remodeling in mouse hearts. Phospholamban (PLN), the reversible inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), is a key regulator of myocyte Ca(2+) cycling with a significant role in heart failure. We previously showed that the single amino acid difference between human and mouse PLN results in increased inhibition of Ca(2+) cycling and cardiac remodeling and attenuated stress responses in transgenic mice expressing the human PLN (hPLN) in the null background. Here we dissect the molecular and electrophysiological processes triggered by the superinhibitory hPLN in the mouse. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we performed global gene expression analysis, electrophysiology, and mathematical simulations on hPLN mice. We identified significant changes in a series of Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis genes/proteins (including Kcnd2, Scn9a, Slc8a1) and ionic conductance (including L-type Ca(2+) current, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, transient outward K(+) current). Simulation analysis suggests that this electrical remodeling has a critical role in rescuing cardiac function by improving sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load and overall Ca(2+) dynamics. Furthermore, multiple structural and transcription factor gene expression changes indicate an ongoing structural remodeling process, favoring hypertrophy and myogenesis while suppressing apoptosis and progression to heart failure. Our findings expand current understanding of the hPLN function and provide additional insights into the downstream implications of SERCA2a superinhibition in the mammalian heart.',\n",
              "  'A phase I pharmacologic study of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR in patients with advanced solid malignancies. PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for disease-directed studies of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully human IgG(1) monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor receptor, and to characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, preliminary antitumor activity, and immunogenicity of necitumumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with 100 to 1,000 mg (flat dosing) necitumumab followed by a 2-week pharmacokinetics sampling period, before beginning 6-week cycles of therapy. RESULTS: Sixty patients received necitumumab weekly (29 patients) or every other week (31 patients). Two patients receiving 1,000 mg every 2 weeks experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT; grade 3 headache), accompanied by grade 3 nausea and vomiting in one patient. Occurring hours after the initial dose, these DLTs established 800 mg as the MTD. Mild dose-related skin toxicity was the most common drug-related toxicity (80%). One patient in each arm experienced grade 3 acneform rash, which responded to oral antibiotics and topical therapy. Toxicity was similar on both schedules. Necitumumab exhibited saturable elimination and nonlinear pharmacokinetics. At 800 mg (both arms), its half-life was approximately 7 days. All patients treated with >or=600 mg necitumumab achieved target trough concentrations (>or=40 microg/mL). Antibodies against necitumumab were not detected. Partial response and stable disease were experienced by 2 and 16 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Well tolerated, necitumumab is associated with preliminary evidence of antitumor activity, and achieves biologically relevant concentrations throughout the dosing period. The recommended dose of necitumumab for further clinical development is 800 mg (flat dose) weekly or every 2 weeks based on the clinical setting.',\n",

              "  'Prominin-1 allows prospective isolation of neural stem cells from the adult murine hippocampus. Prominin-1 (CD133) is commonly used to isolate stem and progenitor cells from the developing and adult nervous system and to identify cancer stem cells in brain tumors. However, despite extensive characterization of Prominin-1(+) precursor cells from the adult subventricular zone, no information about the expression of Prominin-1 by precursor cells in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the adult hippocampus has been available. We show here that Prominin-1 is expressed by a significant number of cells in the SGZ of adult mice in vivo and ex vivo, including postmitotic astrocytes. A small subset of Prominin-1(+) cells coexpressed the nonspecific precursor cell marker Nestin as well as GFAP and Sox2. Upon fluorescence-activated cell sorting, only Prominin-1/Nestin double-positive cells fulfilled the defining stem cell criteria of proliferation, self-renewal, and multipotentiality as assessed by a neurosphere assay. In addition, isolated primary Prominin-1(+) cells preferentially migrated to the neurogenic niche in the SGZ upon transplantation in vivo. Finally, despite its expression by various stem and progenitor cells, Prominin-1 turned out to be dispensable for precursor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, a net decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis, by ∼30% was found in Prominin-1 knock-out mice, suggesting other roles in controlling adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Remarkably, an upregulation of Prominin-2 was detected in Prominin-1-deficient mice highlighting a potential compensatory mechanism, which might explain the lack of severe symptoms in individuals carrying mutations in the Prom1 gene.',\n",
              "  'RANKL expression, function, and therapeutic targeting in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Bone destruction is a prominent feature of multiple myeloma, but conflicting data exist on the expression and pathophysiologic involvement of the bone remodeling ligand RANKL in this disease and the potential therapeutic benefits of its targeted inhibition. Here, we show that RANKL is expressed by primary multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, whereas release of soluble RANKL was observed exclusively with multiple myeloma cells and was strongly influenced by posttranscriptional/posttranslational regulation. Signaling via RANKL into multiple myeloma and CLL cells induced release of cytokines involved in disease pathophysiology. Both the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis and cytokine production by malignant cells could be blocked by disruption of RANK-RANKL interaction with denosumab. As we aimed to combine neutralization of RANKL with induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells against RANKL-expressing malignant cells and as denosumab does not stimulate NK reactivity, we generated RANK-Fc fusion proteins with modified Fc moieties. The latter displayed similar capacity compared with denosumab to neutralize the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis in vitro, but also potently stimulated NK cell reactivity against primary RANKL-expressing malignant B cells, which was dependent on their engineered affinity to CD16. Our findings introduce Fc-optimized RANK-Ig fusion proteins as attractive tools to neutralize the detrimental function of RANKL while at the same time potently stimulating NK cell antitumor immunity.',\n",
              "  \"Polyglutamine expansion induces a protein-damaging stress connecting heat shock protein 70 to the JNK pathway. Polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease, designate a group of nine neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the presence of a toxic polyglutamine expansion in specific target proteins. Using cell and mouse models, we have shown that expanded polyglutamine led to activation of the stress kinase JNK and the transcription factor AP-1, which are implicated in neuronal death. Polyglutamine expansion-induced stress shared common features with protein-damaging stress such as heat shock, because activation of JNK involved inhibition of JNK phosphatase activities. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Aggregation of M3/6 by polyglutamine expansion appeared to be indirect, because M3/6 was not recruited into polyglutamine inclusions. The heat shock protein HSP70, which is known to inhibit JNK during the heat shock response, suppressed polyglutamine-mediated aggregation of M3/6 and activation of JNK. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 were down-regulated by polyglutamine expansion. We suggest that reduction of HSP70 by expanded polyglutamine is implicated in aggregation and inhibition of M3/6 and in activation of JNK and AP-1.\",\n",

OBJECTIVES: To assess the involvement of ficolin-3, the main initiator of the lectin complement pathway (LCP), in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) pathology and outcome. METHODS: In this preliminary exploratory study, plasma concentration of ficolin-3 and of ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was measured, along with that of other LCP initiators (mannose-binding lectin, ficolin-2, and ficolin-1), C3 activation products, and soluble C5b-9 terminal complex, in a prospective cohort of 39 patients with SAH and 20 healthy controls. The following parameters were recorded: SAH severity, assessed using the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale; vasospasm, defined as neuro-worsening with angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing; cerebral ischemia, defined as hypodense lesion on CT scan performed before discharge; and 6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. RESULTS: In patients, no changes were detected for ficolin-3 compared with controls. Notably, however, ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was reduced. Low levels of plasma ficolin-3 and ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity were related to SAH severity, vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia. Moreover, ficolin-3 functional LCP activity was decreased in patients with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that LCP is activated after SAH and that the actual plasma concentrations of ficolin-3 reflect the severity of brain injury as evaluated by clinical and structural parameters. These results support the idea that ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity may be targeted to control injury progression in SAH.',\n",
              "  \"Antimigraine efficacy of telcagepant based on patient's historical triptan response. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the same or different patients respond to triptans and telcagepant. BACKGROUND: Telcagepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist with acute antimigraine efficacy comparable to oral triptans. It is currently unknown whether migraine patients who cannot be adequately helped with triptans might benefit from treatment with telcagepant. METHODS: Post-hoc analysis of data from a randomized, controlled trial of telcagepant (150 mg, 300 mg) zolmitriptan 5 mg, or placebo for a moderate/severe migraine. Responder rates were analyzed according to patients' self-reported historical triptan response (HTR): (1) good HTR (N = 660): response in 75-100% of attacks; (2) intermediate HTR (N = 248): response in 25-74% of attacks; (3) poor HTR/no use (N = 407): response in < 25% of attacks, or patient did not take triptans. A limitation of the analysis is that the last subgroup comprised mainly (91%) patients who reported that they did not take triptans, but it was not known whether these patients were triptan-naïve or had previously used triptans and stopped taking them. RESULTS: For zolmitriptan, 2-hour pain relief rates were higher in the good HTR subgroup (116/162, 72%) than in the intermediate (29/62, 47%) and poor/no use (44/111, 40%) HTR subgroups. The 2-hour pain relief rates were similar across HTR subgroups for telcagepant 150 mg (48-58%), 300 mg (52-58%), and placebo (26-31%). In the poor/no use HTR subgroup, more patients receiving telcagepant 300 mg (56/98, 57.1%) had 2-hour pain relief than those receiving zolmitriptan (44/111, 39.6%; odds ratio = 2.11 [95% CI: 1.20,3.71], P = .009); the percentage for telcagepant 150 mg (57/119, 47.9%) was not significantly different from zolmitriptan (odds ratio = 1.41 [95% CI: 0.82, 2.40], P = .211). CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that different patients may respond to triptans or telcagepant 300 mg. Caution should be exercised in interpreting the results because of the post-hoc nature of the analysis (clinical trial registry: NCT00442936).\",\n",
              "  \"Sp1 binds to the external promoter of the p73 gene and induces the expression of TAp73gamma in lung cancer. The p73 gene possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter, resulting in TAp73 and DeltaNup73 isoforms, respectively. The ultimate effect of p73 in oncogenesis is thought to depend on the apoptotic TA to antiapoptotic DeltaN isoforms' ratio. This study was aimed at identifying novel transcription factors that affect TA isoform synthesis. With the use of bioinformatics tools, in vitro binding assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a region extending -233 to -204 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the human p73 P1 promoter, containing conserved Sp1-binding sites, was characterized. Treatment of cells with Sp1 RNAi and Sp1 inhibitor functionally suppress TAp73 expression, indicating positive regulation of P1 by the Sp1 protein. Notably Sp1 inhibition or knockdown also reduces DeltaNup73 protein levels. Therefore, Sp1 directly regulates TAp73 transcription and affects DeltaNup73 levels in lung cancer. TAp73gamma was shown to be the only TA isoform overexpressed in several lung cancer cell lines and in 26 non-small cell lung cancers, consistent with Sp1 overexpression, thereby questioning the apoptotic role of this specific p73 isoform in lung cancer.\",\n",
              "  'The cyclic pattern of blood alcohol levels during continuous ethanol feeding in rats: the effect of feeding S-adenosylmethionine. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the major methyl donor for DNA and histone methylation was fed with ethanol for 1month in order to modify the effects of ethanol on rat liver. The following parameters were studied to determine the effects of SAMe; liver histology, the blood alcohol cycle (BAL), changes in gene expression mined from microarray analysis, changes in histone methylation, changes in liver SAMe levels and its metabolites and ADH. SAMe changed the type of fatty liver, reduced liver ALT levels and prevented the BAL cycle caused by intragastric ethanol feeding. Microarray analysis showed that SAMe feeding prevented most of the changes in gene expression induced by ethanol feeding, presumably by inducing H3K27me3 and gene silencing. H3K27me3 was significantly increased by SAMe with or without ethanol feeding. It is concluded that SAMe feeding stabilized global gene expression so that the changes in gene expression involved in the blood alcohol cycle were prevented.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To assess gender differences in disease characteristics and treatment responses over time in a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-naive seropositive early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cohort. METHODS: Patients with polyarticular disease who were DMARD-naive and had seropositive early RA (< 14 months) were recruited by the Western Consortium of Practicing Rheumatologists. Each patient was examined at study entry, after 6 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Clinical and demographic data were collected. We investigated gender differences in baseline disease characteristics and treatment using chi-squared, Mann-Whitney U, and t tests. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) models for repeated measures to examine whether the rate of change of specific disease outcomes during the first 2 years after DMARD initiation was significantly influenced by gender. RESULTS: At baseline, men (n = 67) and women (n = 225) had similar disease activity and radiographic damage; men, however, had significantly worse erosion, while women had worse joint space narrowing. Despite similar treatment, women had worse disease progression over the 2-year followup, as assessed by trends in Disease Activity Score 28/erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR4), physician global scores, and tender joint counts. In the GEE model, gender was significantly associated with the rate of change of DAS28-ESR4 scores (p = 0.009), although not independently associated with disease activity. Self-reported measures (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, patient global scores, fatigue, pain) were worse among women at baseline and throughout the study period. Men were more likely to achieve remission. CONCLUSION: At baseline, men and women had similar disease activity and joint damage. Responses to treatment over time were better among men in this prebiologic era; women had worse progression despite similar treatment.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of bedside diagnostic stroke scales in patients with suspected stroke. DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study of patients with suspected acute stroke in an emergency department in a UK hospital. DIAGNOSTIC SCALES: The results of an assessment with the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale, the Face Arm Speech Test (FAST) scale and the diagnosis of definite or probable stroke by an emergency department. Reference standard A consensus diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) made after discussion by an expert panel (members included stroke physicians, neurologists and neuroradiologists), who had access to the clinical findings, imaging and subsequent clinical course, but were blinded to the results of the assessments by emergency-department staff. RESULTS: In 356 patients with complete data, the expert panel assigned a diagnosis of acute stroke or TIA in 246 and a diagnosis of mimic in 110. The ROSIER had a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI 78 to 87) and specificity of 44% (95% CI 34 to 53), and the FAST had a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI 76 to 86) and a specificity of 39% (95% CI 30 to 48). There was no detectable difference between the scales in sensitivity (p = 0.39) or specificity (p = 0.30). CONCLUSIONS: The simpler FAST scale could replace the more complex ROSIER for the initial assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke in the emergency department.',\n",

Naturally occurring foam constituent and surfactant proteins with intriguing structures and functions are now being identified from a variety of biological sources. The ranaspumins from tropical frog foam nests comprise a range of proteins with a mixture of surfactant, carbohydrate binding and antimicrobial activities that together provide a stable, biocompatible, protective foam environment for developing eggs and embryos. Ranasmurfin, a blue protein from a different species of frog, displays a novel structure with a unique chromophoric crosslink. Latherin, primarily from horse sweat, but with similarities to salivary, oral and upper respiratory tract proteins, illustrates several potential roles for surfactant proteins in mammalian systems. These proteins, together with the previously discovered hydrophobins of fungi, throw new light on biomolecular processes at air-water and other interfaces. This review provides a perspective on these recent findings, focussing on structure and biophysical properties.',\n",
              "  'Inducible priming phosphorylation promotes ligand-independent degradation of the IFNAR1 chain of type I interferon receptor. Phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and ensuing down-regulation and lysosomal degradation of the interferon alpha/beta receptor chain 1 (IFNAR1) of the receptor for Type I interferons play important roles in limiting the cellular responses to these cytokines. These events could be stimulated either by the ligands (in a Janus kinase-dependent manner) or by unfolded protein response (UPR) inducers including viral infection (in a manner dependent on the activity of pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase). Both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways converge on phosphorylation of Ser(535) within the IFNAR1 degron leading to recruitment of beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin ligase and concomitant ubiquitination and degradation. Casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1 alpha) was shown to directly phosphorylate Ser(535) within the ligand-independent pathway. Yet given the constitutive activity of CK1 alpha, it remained unclear how this pathway is stimulated by UPR. Here we report that induction of UPR promotes the phosphorylation of a proximal residue, Ser(532), in a pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase-dependent manner. This serine serves as a priming site that promotes subsequent phosphorylation of IFNAR1 within its degron by CK1 alpha. These events play an important role in regulating ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1 as well as the extent of Type I interferon signaling.',\n",
              "  'Phase 1 study of twice-weekly ixazomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor, in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients. Ixazomib is the first investigational oral proteasome inhibitor to be studied clinically. In this phase 1 trial, 60 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (median of 4 prior lines of therapy; bortezomib, lenalidomide, thalidomide, and carfilzomib/marizomib in 88%, 88%, 62%, and 5%, respectively) received single-agent ixazomib 0.24 to 2.23 mg/m(2) (days 1, 4, 8, 11; 21-day cycles). Two dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3 rash; grade 4 thrombocytopenia) occurred at 2.23 mg/m(2). The maximum tolerated dose was 2.0 mg/m(2), which 40 patients received in 4 expansion cohorts. Patients received a median of 4 cycles (range, 1-39); 18% received > 12 cycles. Eighty-eight percent had drug-related adverse events, including nausea (42%), thrombocytopenia (42%), fatigue (40%), and rash (40%); drug-related grade > 3 events included thrombocytopenia (37%) and neutropenia (17%). Grade 1/2 drug-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in 12% (no grade > 3). Two patients died on the study (both considered unrelated to treatment). The terminal half-life of ixazomib was 3.3 to 7.4 days; plasma exposure increased proportionally with dose (0.48-2.23 mg/m(2)). Among 55 response-evaluable patients, 15% achieved partial response or better (76% stable disease or better). These findings have informed the subsequent clinical development of ixazomib in multiple myeloma. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00932698.',\n",
              "  'Protective effect of JTV519, a new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, on prolonged myocardial preservation. BACKGROUND: JTV519 is know to protect cardiomyocytes from calcium overloading-induced damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective effect of JTV519 on myocardium subjected to prolonged ischemia and the underlying mechanism of such protection. The effect of JTV519 was also compared with that of diltiazem, a 1,5-benzothiazepine derivative. METHODS: Isolated rat hearts were randomly divided into three groups. Control hearts were arrested with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarat (HTK) cardioplegic solution alone. In the JTV519 group of hearts, cardiac arrest was achieved with JTV519 (10(-3) mmol/L) in the HTK solution. Hearts in the diltiazem group were arrested with diltiazem (0.5 mmol/L) in the HTK solution. All the hearts were then subjected to 6-hour storage in HTK solution at 4 degrees C. RESULTS: After a 30-minute reperfusion, the left ventricular developed pressure in the JTV519 and diltiazem groups were improved significantly compared with the control group. There was a significantly lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure level and higher recovery of coronary flow in the JTV519 group than in the control group. The postischemic intracellular calcium concentration was attenuated by adding JTV519 or diltiazem to HTK cardioplegia. CONCLUSION: As an adjunct to cardioplegia, JTV519 showed a significant protective effect on myocardium undergoing 6 hours of ischemia. The beneficial protective effects of JTV519 are correlated with its ability to inhibit the postischemic rise in intracellular calcium.',\n",
              "  'Orteronel for the treatment of prostate cancer. Orteronel (also known as TAK-700) is a novel hormonal therapy that is currently in testing for the treatment of prostate cancer. Orteronel inhibits the 17,20 lyase activity of the enzyme CYP17A1, which is important for androgen synthesis in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells. Preclinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment suppresses androgen levels and causes shrinkage of androgen-dependent organs, such as the prostate gland. Early reports of clinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment leads to reduced prostate-specific antigen levels, a marker of prostate cancer tumor burden, and more complete suppression of androgen synthesis than conventional androgen deprivation therapies that act in the testes alone. Treatment with single-agent orteronel has been well tolerated with fatigue as the most common adverse event, while febrile neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in a combination study of orteronel with docetaxel. Recently, the ELM-PC5 Phase III clinical trial in patients with advanced-stage prostate cancer who had received prior docetaxel was unblinded as the overall survival primary end point was not achieved. However, additional Phase III orteronel trials are ongoing in men with earlier stages of prostate cancer.',\n",
              "  \"Overexpression of the human tissue kallikrein genes KLK4, 5, 6, and 7 increases the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer cells. The human tissue kallikrein family of serine proteases (hK1-hK15 encoded by the genes KLK1-KLK15) is involved in several cancer-related processes. Accumulating evidence suggests that certain tissue kallikreins are part of an enzymatic cascade pathway that is activated in ovarian cancer and other malignant diseases. In the present study, OV-MZ-6 ovarian cancer cells were stably co-transfected with plasmids expressing hK4, hK5, hK6, and hK7. These cells displayed similar proliferative capacity as the vector-transfected control cells (which do not express any of the four tissue kallikreins), but showed significantly increased invasive behavior in an in vitro Matrigel invasion assay (p<0.01; Mann-Whitney U-test). For in vivo analysis, the cancer cells were inoculated into the peritoneum of nude mice. Simultaneous expression of hK4, hK5, hK6, and hK7 resulted in a remarkable 92% mean increase in tumor burden compared to the vector-control cell line. Five out of 14 mice in the 'tissue kallikrein overexpressing' group displayed a tumor/situs ratio greater than 0.198, while this weight limit was not exceeded at all in the vector control group consisting of 13 mice (p=0.017; chi2 test). Our results strongly support the view that tumor-associated overexpression of tissue kallikreins contributes to ovarian cancer progression.\",\n",

Flumazenil is indicated for reversal of sedation from benzodiazepines administered during therapeutic or diagnostic procedures and during induction or maintenance of general anesthesia, as well as for benzodiazepine overdose. Bolus doses of flumazenil are usually adequate to achieve reversal; however, when medical conditions may lead to a prolonged half-life of the benzodiazepine involved, continuous infusion may be warranted. A 67-year-old man with chlordiazepoxide toxicity required a 9-day infusion of flumazenil to prevent resedation and respiratory insufficiency; he initially was admitted to the hospital for alcohol detoxification. Concomitant medical conditions and the metabolism characteristics of each benzodiazepine must dictate the agent of choice. When measures are required to ensure adequate recovery of a patient's respiratory function and mental awareness, such as in patients with benzodiazepine toxicity, consideration of continuous-infusion flumazenil is warranted.\",\n",
              "  \"Telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L) limits the lifespan of human pancreatic cancer cells. Telomerase is required for the unlimited lifespan of cancer cells. The vast majority of pancreatic adenocarcinomas overexpress telomerase activity and blocking telomerase could limit their lifespan. GRN163L (Imetelstat) is a lipid-conjugated N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide that blocks the template region of telomerase. The aim of this study was to define the effects of long-term GRN163L exposure on the maintenance of telomeres and lifespan of pancreatic cancer cells. Telomere size, telomerase activity, and telomerase inhibition response to GRN163L were measured in a panel of 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines. The cell lines exhibited large differences in levels of telomerase activity (46-fold variation), but most lines had very short telomeres (2-3 kb in size). GRN163L inhibited telomerase in all 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines, with IC50 ranging from 50 nM to 200 nM. Continuous GRN163L exposure of CAPAN1 (IC50 = 75 nM) and CD18 cells (IC50 = 204 nM) resulted in an initial rapid shortening of the telomeres followed by the maintenance of extremely short but stable telomeres. Continuous exposure to the drug eventually led to crisis and to a complete loss of viability after 47 (CAPAN1) and 69 (CD18) doublings. Crisis In these cells was accompanied by activation of a DNA damage response (γ-H2AX) and evidence of both senescence (SA-β-galactosidase activity) and apoptosis (sub-G1 DNA content, PARP cleavage). Removal of the drug after long-term GRN163L exposure led to a reactivation of telomerase and re-elongation of telomeres in the third week of cultivation without GRN163L. These findings show that the lifespan of pancreatic cancer cells can be limited by continuous telomerase inhibition. These results should facilitate the design of future clinical trials of GRN163L in patients with pancreatic cancer.\",\n",
              "  'The development of dasatinib as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): from initial studies to application in newly diagnosed patients. PURPOSE: Dasatinib is a dual Abl/Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed as a prototypic short-acting BCR-ABL-targeted TKI that inhibits BCR-ABL with greater potency compared with imatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib and has been shown to have potential immunomodulatory effects. Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of all phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib treatment and first-line treatment for CML in chronic phase. In this article, the development of dasatinib as a treatment for patients with CML is reviewed. METHODS: This is a review of the relevant literature regarding dasatinib development in CML (2003-2013). RESULTS: Dasatinib demonstrates efficacy against most BCR-ABL mutations arising during imatinib therapy and is effective in treating patients with imatinib resistance due to other mechanisms. Randomized trial data show that first-line dasatinib provides superior responses compared with imatinib and enables patients to achieve early, deep responses correlated with improved longer-term outcomes. Dasatinib has a generally acceptable safety profile, with most adverse events (AEs) proving manageable and reversible. Cytopenias are commonly observed with dasatinib, and some nonhematologic AEs including pleural effusion have been consistently reported. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib is an effective treatment option for patients with CML.',\n",
              "  \"Primary cutaneous pre-B lymphoblastic lymphoma immunohistologically mimics Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor. Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas (B-LBLs) are rare and most often involve the skin in the head and neck region. Histologically, cutaneous B-LBLs may be confused with other small round-cell neoplasms. Moreover, half of B-LBL patients are negative for CD45 (leucocyte common antigen, LCA), a widely used marker for the diagnosis of lymphoma, and a significant portion express CD99, a marker for Ewing's sarcoma (ES) or primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Therefore, an extranodal B-LBL may be misinterpreted as PNET or ES. Here, we report on 2 boys, aged 10 and 5 years, with primary cutaneous B-LBL of the scalp. PNET was initially misdiagnosed because the tumor cells were negative for CD45 but strongly positive for CD99. Advanced stage of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed later and both patients died during the course of treatment for ALL. In retrospective analyses, tumor cells in the initial biopsy specimens of both patients were found to be reactive to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD43 and CD10. Thus, the diagnosis of B-LBL was confirmed. These cases illustrate the possibility that primary cutaneous B-LBL may mimic ES or PNET immunophenotypically, and that correct diagnosis in doubtful cases may be facilitated by analysis using a complete panel of antibodies, particularly including TdT and CD43.\",\n",
              "  'Monitoring twenty-six chronic myeloid leukemia patients by BCR-ABL mRNA level in bone marrow:a single hospital experience. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL oncogene. The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) from a reciprocal translocation, t(9;22) (q34;q11) causes a fusion gene, BCR-ABL, that encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. Treatment of CML by imatinib is effective to control the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the protein related to the cell signaling. BCR-ABL mRNA is overexpressed in the minimal residual disease (MRD), known as an early sign of relapse. Between December 2005 and June 2008, we measured BCR-ABL mRNA levels in the bone marrow (BM) from patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital. Eighty-six samples from 26 patients were collected. Among the 26 CML patients, 11 patients (42%) were in the pretreatment group. Seven (64%) of the 11 patients achieved complete molecular response (CMR). In the post-treatment group consisting of the remaining 15 patients, 9 (60%) patients achieved CMR. The patients receiving imatinib at a dose over 300 mg per day required 13 (6-77) months [median (range)] to achieve CMR. On the other hand, the patients receiving a dose below 300 mg per day required 29.5 (11-84) months [median (range)]. When BCR-ABL mRNA was detected during the treatment course of patients with CMR, careful observation of BCR-ABL mRNA was useful for tracking the clinical course of patients. In conclusion, the BCR-ABL mRNA level was useful for monitoring the clinical course in 26 patients with CML.',\n",

              "  'Targeting chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) arises as a consequence of a chromosomal translocation giving rise to the Philadelphia chromosome and Bcr-Abl oncogene. CML is a clonal disease of stem cell origin and an excellent example of a malignancy in which tumor-initiating cells may hold the key to disease eradication. The known molecular basis of CML has enabled the development of Abl-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate. However, the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as rationally designed first-line therapies, has been tempered by problems of disease persistence and resistance. Residual disease has been shown to be enriched within the stem cell compartment and to persist at stable levels for up to 5 years of complete cytogenetic response. This finding has led to further searches for novel strategies aimed at eliminating these cells; such strategies may be essential in achieving cure. The most significant recent findings are discussed in this review.',\n",
              "  \"Long-term outcomes in the second-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia: a review of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a progressive and often fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm. The hallmark of CML is an acquired chromosomal translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which results in the synthesis of the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) fusion oncoprotein, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The introduction of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is specific for BCR-ABL, was a major breakthrough in CML therapy. Although most patients respond to first-line imatinib therapy, some experience loss of response (resistance) or require treatment discontinuation because of toxicity (intolerance). For patients with CML, failure on standard-dose imatinib therapy (400 mg daily), imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg daily) is a second-line option. However, high-dose imatinib is not an appropriate approach for patients who experience drug toxicity, and there remain questions over the durability of responses achieved with this strategy. Alternative second-line options include the TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib. A substantial amount of long-term data for these agents is available. Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacologic profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutation status. To optimize therapeutic benefit, clinicians should select treatment based on each patient's historic response, adverse-event tolerance, and risk factors.\",\n",

              "  'Biological implications of selenium and its role in trypanosomiasis treatment. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for several organisms and is present in proteins as selenocysteine (Sec or U), an amino acid that is chemically distinct from serine and cysteine by a single atom (Se instead of O or S, respectively). Sec is incorporated into selenoproteins at an in-frame UGA codon specified by an mRNA stem-loop structure called the selenocysteine incorporating sequence (SECIS) presented in selenoprotein mRNA and specific selenocysteine synthesis and incorporation machinery. Selenoproteins are presented in all domains but are not found in all organisms. Although several functions have been attributed to this class, the majority of the proteins are involved in oxidative stress defense. Here, we discuss the kinetoplastid selenocysteine pathway and how selenium supplementation is able to alter the infection course of trypanosomatids in detail. These organisms possess the canonical elements required for selenoprotein production such as phosphoseryl tRNA kinase (PSTK), selenocysteine synthase (SepSecS), selenophosphase synthase (SelD or SPS), and elongation factor EFSec (SelB), whereas other important factors presented in mammal cells, such as SECIS binding protein 2 (SBP) and SecP 43, are absent. The selenoproteome of trypanosomatids is small, as is the selenoproteome of others parasites, which is in contrast to the large number of selenoproteins found in bacteria, aquatic organisms and higher eukaryotes. Trypanosoma and Leishmania are sensitive to auranofin, a potent selenoprotein inhibitor; however, the probable drug mechanism is not related to selenoproteins in kinetoplastids. Selenium supplementation decreases the parasitemia of various Trypanosome infections and reduces important parameters associated with diseases such as anemia and parasite-induced organ damage. New experiments are necessary to determine how selenium acts, but evidence suggests that immune response modulation and increased host defense against oxidative stress contribute to control of the parasite infection.',\n",

The effects of 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a newly synthesized Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) inhibitor, on the NCX current and other membrane currents were examined in isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes and compared with those of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy) phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). SEA0400 concentration-dependently inhibited the NCX current with a 10 fold higher potency than that of KB-R7943; 1 microM SEA0400 and 10 microM KB-R7943 inhibited the NCX current by more than 80%. KB-R7943, at 10 microM, inhibited the sodium current, L-type calcium current, delayed rectifier potassium current and inwardly rectifying potassium current by more than 50%, but SEA0400 (1 microM) had no significant effect on these currents.

The carboxyl-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), or a closely-related sequence, is important for ER localization of both lumenal as well as type II membrane proteins. This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, and mouse L cells. We show that rab1 is an excellent marker of the intermediate compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, including the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues. However, some stress conditions, such as infection with vaccinia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus, as well as 20 degrees C or 43 degrees C treatment, resulted in a significant shift of the distribution towards the trans-TGN side of the Golgi stack. This shift could be quantified in HeLa cells stably expressing a TGN marker. No significant labeling was detected in structures distal to the TGN under all conditions tested. After GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells, the receptor was detected in the beta-COP-containing buds/vesicles that accumulate after this treatment, suggesting that these vesicles may transport the receptor between compartments. We propose that retrieval of KDEL-containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway, and that within this pathway, the amounts of the receptor in different compartments varies according to physiological conditions.',\n",
              "  'Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, as add-on to metformin in type 2 diabetes with mild hyperglycaemia. AIMS: To evaluate the effects of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin added to metformin for 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 495 participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin [haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >7 to < 10%] to receive 1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg empagliflozin once daily (QD), or placebo, or open-label sitagliptin (100 mg QD), added to metformin for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12 (empagliflozin groups versus placebo). RESULTS: Reductions in HbA1c of -0.09 to -0.56% were observed with empagliflozin after 12 weeks, versus an increase of 0.15% with placebo (baseline: 7.8-8.1%). Compared with placebo, empagliflozin doses from 5 to 50 mg resulted in reductions in fasting plasma glucose (-2 to -28 mg/dl vs. 5 mg/dl with placebo; p < 0.0001) and body weight (-2.3 to -2.9 kg vs. -1.2 kg; p < 0.01). Frequency of adverse events was generally similar with empagliflozin (29.6-48.6%), placebo (36.6%) and sitagliptin (35.2%). Hypoglycaemia rates were very low and balanced among groups. Most frequent adverse events with empagliflozin were urinary tract infections (4.0% vs. 2.8% with placebo) and pollakiuria (2.5% vs. 1.4% with placebo). Genital infections were reported only with empagliflozin (4.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Once daily empagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin was well tolerated except for increased genital infections and resulted in reductions in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.',\n",
              "  'JTV519 (K201) reduces sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ leak and improves diastolic function in vitro in murine and human non-failing myocardium. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ca²⁺ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction. RyR2 Ca²⁺ leak has been related to RyR2 phosphorylation. In these conditions, JTV519 (K201), a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative and multi-channel blocker, stabilizes RyR2s and decrease SR Ca²⁺ leak. We investigated whether JTV519 stabilizes RyR2s without increasing RyR2 phosphorylation in mice and in non-failing human myocardium and explored underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: SR Ca²⁺ leak was induced by ouabain in murine cardiomyocytes. [Ca²⁺]-transients, SR Ca²⁺ load and RyR2-mediated Ca²⁺ leak (sparks/waves) were quantified, with or without JTV519 (1 µmol·L⁻¹). Contribution of Ca²⁺ -/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was assessed by KN-93 and Western blot (RyR2-Ser(2814) phosphorylation). Effects of JTV519 on contractile force were investigated in non-failing human ventricular trabeculae. KEY RESULTS: Ouabain increased systolic and diastolic cytosolic [Ca²⁺](i) , SR [Ca²⁺], and SR Ca²⁺ leak (Ca²⁺ spark (SparkF) and Ca²⁺ wave frequency), independently of CaMKII and RyR-Ser(2814) phosphorylation. JTV519 decreased SparkF but also SR Ca²⁺ load. At matched SR [Ca²⁺], Ca²⁺ leak was significantly reduced by JTV519, but it had no effect on fractional Ca²⁺ release or Ca²⁺ wave propagation velocity. In human muscle, JTV519 was negatively inotropic at baseline but significantly enhanced ouabain-induced force and reduced its deleterious effects on diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: JTV519 was effective in reducing SR Ca²⁺ leak by specifically regulating RyR2 opening at diastolic [Ca²⁺](i) in the absence of increased RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser(2814) , extending the potential use of JTV519 to conditions of acute cellular Ca²⁺ overload.',\n",
              "  'Transcription-coupled repair: a complex affair. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is generally observed as more rapid or more efficient removal of certain types of DNA damage from the transcribed strands of expressed genes compared with the nontranscribed strands. It has been clearly demonstrated to be a subpathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in E. coli, yeast and mammalian cells. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that it is a highly complex process and requires the participation of the NER pathway, the RNA polymerase complex and additional factors. An early event in TCR is likely the blocking of RNA polymerase complex elongation by damage present in the transcribed strands of expressed genes. Whether TCR is involved in base excision repair pathways or the repair of common forms of oxidative damage is less clear. This review is focused on the description of possible mechanisms of TCR in E. coli and mammalian cells.',\n",
              "  'Cadmium induces nuclear export of Bach1, a transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase-1 gene. The export of certain nuclear proteins is involved in the regulation of various nuclear functions, including transcription. In some cases, the export of target proteins is induced upon environmental or cellular cues, resulting in conditional gene expression. The small Maf proteins appear to be critical regulators of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, an anti-oxidant defense enzyme that degrades heme into iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin. Although ho-1 is repressed by Bach1/small Maf heterodimers, it is activated by Nrf2/small Maf heterodimers, indicating that Bach1 and Nrf2 compete with each other. We anticipated that the nuclear concentration of Bach1 might be regulated to ensure that the entire system effectively responds to various stimuli. We carried out detailed domain analysis of Bach1 in an effort to understand how various inducers of HO-1 inactivate Bach1. We show here that cadmium, a strong inducer of HO-1, activates the nuclear export of Bach1. This cadmium-induced export of Bach1 was mediated in trans by its C-terminal region that is conserved between Bach1 and Bach2. The nuclear export of Bach2 was also induced by cadmium, indicating that the cadmium responsibility is shared between Bach1 and Bach2. The nuclear export of Bach1 was dependent on Crm1/Exportin-1 as well as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) activity. These results indicate that the nuclear export of Bach1 constitutes an important regulatory mechanism to relieve the Bach1-mediated repression of genes such as ho-1.',\n",

X chromosome inactivation begins when a novel chromosomal RNA (cRNA) from the imprinted mouse Xist or human XIST locus coats or \"paints\" one X chromosome in cis and initiates a cascade of chromosome remodeling events. Molecular cytological studies have proven invaluable for understanding the distinctive cellular behavior of this singular RNA involved in chromosome structure and regulation. While the detailed mechanism of XIST/Xist (X-inactivation Specific Transcript) RNA function remains largely unknown, recent advances provide new insights into the complex cellular factors which impact the RNA\\'s localization to the chromosome, as well as the early events of chromosome remodeling that follow painting by Xist RNA. Because chromatin changes can be directly visualized on a silenced chromosome, X chromosome inactivation provides an advantageous model to investigate genome-wide heterochromatin formation and maintenance, with wide-ranging implications for normal cells and disease.',\n",
              "  \"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor use in pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic anemia. Until recently, pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was associated with an extremely poor outcome when treated with chemotherapy alone, and only modest survival benefits were obtained with the widespread use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The development of first-generation (imatinib) and second-generation (dasatinib and nilotinib) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein produced by the Ph chromosome revolutionized the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The Children's Oncology Group (COG) AALL0031 trial showed that the addition of imatinib to intensive chemotherapy did not cause increased toxicity and resulted in 3-year event-free survival rates that were more than double those of historical control data from the pre-imatinib era. These findings create a new paradigm for integrating molecularly targeted agents with conventional chemotherapy and call for a reassessment of the routine use of HSCT for children and adolescents with Ph(+) ALL. Second-generation TKIs have theoretical advantages over imatinib, and are now being tested in Ph(+) ALL. The focus of contemporary trials is to define the optimal use of chemotherapy, HSCT, and TKI in Ph(+) ALL. In the coming years, it is anticipated that additional agents will become available to potentiate TKI therapy and/or circumvent TKI resistance in Ph(+) ALL. Recent genomic studies have identified a subtype of high-risk pediatric B-cell-precursor ALL with a gene-expression profile similar to that of Ph(+) ALL, suggestive of active kinase signaling. Many of these Ph-like ALL cases harbor chromosome rearrangements and mutations that dysregulate cytokine receptor and kinase signaling, and these leukemias may also be candidates for TKI therapy.\",\n",

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), the most prevalent myopathy afflicting both children and adults, is predominantly associated with contractions in the 4q35-localized macrosatellite D4Z4 repeat array. Recent studies have proposed that FSHD pathology is caused by the misexpression of the DUX4 (double homeobox 4) gene resulting in production of a pathogenic protein, DUX4-FL, which has been detected in FSHD, but not in unaffected control myogenic cells and muscle tissue. Here, we report the analysis of DUX4 mRNA and protein expression in a much larger collection of myogenic cells and muscle biopsies derived from biceps and deltoid muscles of FSHD affected subjects and their unaffected first-degree relatives. We confirmed that stable DUX4-fl mRNA and protein were expressed in myogenic cells and muscle tissues derived from FSHD affected subjects, including several genetically diagnosed adult FSHD subjects yet to show clinical manifestations of the disease in the assayed muscles. In addition, we report DUX4-fl mRNA and protein expression in muscle biopsies and myogenic cells from genetically unaffected relatives of the FSHD subjects, although at a significantly lower frequency. These results establish that DUX4-fl expression per se is not sufficient for FSHD muscle pathology and indicate that quantitative modifiers of DUX4-fl expression and/or function and family genetic background are determinants of FSHD muscle disease progression.',\n",

Clostridium botulinum is the etiological agent of botulism. Due to food-borne poisoning and the potential use of the extremely toxic botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) from C. botulinum in bioterror or biocrime related actions, reliable high resolution typing methods for discriminating C. botulinum strains are needed. Partial sequencing of the adk, atpH, gyrB, proC, rpoD and spo0A genes from 51 various C. botulinum/sporogenes isolates was performed, resulting in 37 different sequence types (STs). Analysis of the sequence data revealed a genetic distribution in five larger clusters with a loose correlation to the BoNT serotypes. The developed MLST assay had a slightly lower resolution ability when compared to the MLVA (multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis), but the two methods resulted in similar subclusters of the strains possessing the BoNT serotypes A, B and F. The current work presents the development of a novel MLST assay useful for genotyping C. botulinum related to basic phylogenetic research and trace-back analysis in microbial forensic studies.',\n",
              "  'In vitro effects of STI 571-containing drug combinations on the growth of Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. BACKGROUND: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a molecular aberration, a fusion BCR-ABL gene encoding for aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, which is crucial in the pathogenesis of CML. In vitro, inhibition of BCR-ABL protein tyrosine kinase activity by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (STI571; formerly CGP57148B), successfully suppressed proliferation/survival of the BCR-ABL positive clones. In clinical studies, hematologic and cytogenetic remissions have been achieved in most patients with chronic phase CML; in accelerated and blastic phases of CML, STI571 appeared less effective. In the current study, the authors tested combinations of STI571 and cytarabine and homoharringtonine (HHT), drugs with documented activity in CML. METHODS: The single agents and their combinations were studied for in vitro effect on proliferation of BCR-ABL positive cell lines KBM5 and KBM7 by 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5 diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay and on primary patient-derived BCR-ABL cells by clonogenic assays. The in vitro additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects of cytarabine and HHT with STI571 were then investigated by computer-assisted analysis using the CalcuSyn software. RESULTS: STI571 consistently suppressed BCR-ABL positive cell proliferation with a dose-effect correlation. In the model system used, STI571/cytarabine and STI571/HHT combinations were more effective in inhibiting KBM5 and KBM7 cell growth than each drug as single agent. These results were also verified in primary CML-derived clonogenic cells in semisolid cultures. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental system, our studies documented additive or synergistic effects with STI571 plus cytarabine or HHT, supporting the future use of STI571 combinations in clinical trials in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.',\n",
              "  \"Impact of training for healthcare professionals on how to manage an opioid overdose with naloxone: effective, but dissemination is challenging. BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose has a high mortality, but is often reversible with appropriate overdose management and naloxone (opioid antagonist). Training in these skills has been successfully trialled internationally with opioid users themselves. Healthcare professionals working in substance misuse are in a prime position to deliver overdose prevention training to drug users and may themselves witness opioid overdoses. The best method of training dissemination has not been identified. The study assessed post-training change in clinician knowledge for managing an opioid overdose and administering naloxone, evaluated the 'cascade method' for disseminating training, and identified barriers to implementation. METHODS: A repeated-measures design evaluated knowledge pre-and-post training. A sub-set of clinicians were interviewed to identify barriers to implementation. Clinicians from addiction services across England received training. Participants self-completed a structured questionnaire recording overdose knowledge, confidence and barriers to implementation. RESULTS: One hundred clinicians were trained initially, who trained a further 119 clinicians (n=219) and thereafter trained 239 drug users. The mean composite score for opioid overdose risk signs and actions to be taken was 18.3/26 (±3.8) which increased to 21.2/26 (±4.1) after training, demonstrating a significant improvement in knowledge (Z=9.2, p<0.001). The proportion of clinicians willing to use naloxone in an opioid overdose rose from 77% to 99% after training. Barriers to implementing training were clinician time and confidence, service resources, client willingness and naloxone formulation. CONCLUSIONS: Training clinicians how to manage an opioid overdose and administer naloxone was effective. However the 'cascade method' was only modestly successful for disseminating training to a large clinician workforce, with a range of clinician and service perceived obstacles. Drug policy changes and improvements to educational programmes for drug services would be important to ensure successful implementation of overdose training internationally.\",\n",
              "  'Expression of DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalities such as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, developmental abnormality of fin muscle, disorganization of facial musculature and/or degeneration of trunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant localization of myogenic cells marked with α-actin promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside somite boundary, especially in head region. These abnormalities were rescued by coinjection of the short form of DUX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, even at extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FSHD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also propose that DUX4 expression during development is important for the pathogenesis of FSHD.',\n",
              "  'Label-free MSE proteomic analysis of chronic myeloid leukemia bone marrow plasma: disclosing new insights from therapy resistance. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a pluripotent hematopoietic disorder that is currently considered incurable. The tyrosine kinase product of the Philadelphia chromosome, P210 BCR-ABL, provided a pathogenetic explanation for the initiation of the CML chronic phase and is the molecular therapeutic target for the disease. Imatinib mesylate, an orally available BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, can induce haematologic and cytogenetic remission of CML. However, imatinib resistance occurs frequently, resulting in relapse. New treatment strategies are focusing on resistant CML stem cells and the bone marrow stroma. The identification of novel pathways and mechanisms in the bone marrow microenvironment could significantly contribute to the development of such strategies. In this work, we used a high-resolution label-free MS(E) proteomic approach to identify differential protein expression in the CML bone marrow plasma of responsive and resistant patients. Oxidative lipid metabolism and regulation of the switch from canonical to noncanonical WNT signaling may contribute to CML resistance in the bone marrow compartment.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Current drugs for myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, do not induce complete or partial remissions. Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. METHODS: We sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic activity and safety of imetelstat in patients with high-risk or intermediate-2-risk myelofibrosis. Imetelstat was administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (starting dose, 9.4 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 1 to 3 weeks. The primary end point was the overall response rate, and the secondary end points were adverse events, spleen response, and independence from red-cell transfusions. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (median age, 67 years) met the eligibility criteria; 48% had received prior JAK inhibitor therapy. A complete or partial remission occurred in 7 patients (21%), with a median duration of response of 18 months (range, 13 to 20+) for complete responses and 10 months (range, 7 to 10+) for partial responses. Bone marrow fibrosis was reversed in all 4 patients who had a complete response, and a molecular response occurred in 3 of the 4 patients. Response rates were 27% among patients with a JAK2 mutation versus 0% among those without a JAK2 mutation (P=0.30) and 32% among patients without an ASXL1 mutation versus 0% among those with an ASXL1 mutation (P=0.07). The rate of complete response was 38% among patients with a mutation in SF3B1 or U2AF1 versus 4% among patients without a mutation in these genes (P=0.04). Responses did not correlate with baseline telomere length. Treatment-related adverse events included grade 4 thrombocytopenia (in 18% of patients), grade 4 neutropenia (in 12%), grade 3 anemia (in 30%), and grade 1 or 2 elevation in levels of total bilirubin (in 12%), alkaline phosphatase (in 21%), and aspartate aminotransferase (in 27%). CONCLUSIONS: Imetelstat was found to be active in patients with myelofibrosis but also had the potential to cause clinically significant myelosuppression.

The tools and techniques used in single-cell analysis of DNA damage in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are limited. In this study, we modified the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, namely, the single chromosome comet assay based on DNA break analysis, at the chromosomal level. We studied the largest yeast chromosome XII, which contains the rDNA locus, and we investigated its instability using cell cycle checkpoint-, DNA damage- and antioxidative defence-deficient, and lifespan-deregulated yeast mutant strains. Moreover, we compared chromosome XII instability with the variability of nucleolar rDNA fluorescence signals. Three single-gene-deletion strains, cells lacking single-stranded DNA endonuclease, Rad1p; NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase, Sir2p; and gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase, Gsh1p, were more prone to chromosome XII instability compared to corresponding wildtype strains, indicating that DNA damage repair machinery, chromatin silencing and redox homeostasis may contribute to genome stability. Elevation in the number of DNA breaks was correlated with a high variability in the levels of nucleolar rDNA in the Δrad1 background, while unaffected chromosome XII and low variability in nucleolar rDNA fluorescence signals were observed in the Δtor1 longevity mutant. Taken together, the single chromosome comet assay may be successfully used to study DNA damage at the chromosomal level, which might be overlooked using whole population analysis on DNA breaks with PFGE separation.',\n",

Recently mutations in the gene ZFHX1B (SIP1) were shown in patients with \"syndromic Hirschsprung disease\" with mental retardation (MR) and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA), but it was unclear if Hirschsprung disease is an obligate symptom of these mutations and if the distinct facial phenotype delineated by Mowat et al. [1998: J Med Genet 35: 617-623] is specific for ZFHX1B mutations. In order to address these open questions we analyzed the ZFHX1B gene in five patients, three of whom had \"syndromic Hirschsprung disease\" two with and one without the facial phenotype described by Mowat et al. [1998], and two of whom had the distinct facial gestalt without Hirschsprung disease. Analyses of microsatellite markers and newly identified SNPs, and/or FISH with BACs from the ZFHX1B region excluded large deletions in all five patients. Direct sequencing demonstrated truncating ZFHX1B mutations in all four patients with the characteristic facial phenotype, but not in the patient with syndromic Hirschsprung disease without the distinct facial appearance. We demonstrate that there is a specific clinical entity with a recognizable facial gestalt, mental retardation and variable MCAs which we propose be called the \"Mowat-Wilson syndrome.\"',\n",

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the Philadelphia translocation that fuses BCR sequences from chromosome 22 upstream of the ABL gene on chromosome 9. The chimerical Bcr-Abl protein expressed by CML cells has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, which is essential for the pathogenesis of the disease. Imatinib, an ATP-competitive selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, has unprecedented efficacy for the treatment of CML. Most patients with early stage disease achieve durable complete hematological and complete cytogenetic remissions, with minimal toxicity. In contrast, responses are less stable in patients with advanced CML. This review highlights the pathogenesis of CML, its clinical features, and the development of imatinib as a specific molecularly targeted therapy. Aspects of disease monitoring and side effects are covered as well as resistance to imatinib and strategies to overcome resistance, such as alternative signal transduction inhibitors and drug combinations.

              "  '2-(4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). It is involved in the regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). There are three receptor subtypes within the G-protein–coupled 5-HT2 receptor family: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors are abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine nucleus, legmental area, and myelencephalon (5). 5-HT2A receptors are involved in mediation of normal and psychotic states, working memory, regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal cells, sleep, peripheral pain, and cardiovascular functions. 5-HT2B receptors are found mainly in several peripheral tissues, such as the stomach, intestine, pulmonary smooth muscle, and myocardium. In the brain, 5-HT2B receptors are found in discrete nuclei of the cerebellum, lateral septum, dorsal hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and amygdala. 5-HT2C receptors are found in the choroid plexus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and ventromedial thalamus. 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in several psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological role of 5-HT2A receptors. There have been several studies to develop specific 5-HT2A radioligands, such as [11C]ketanserin (6), [18F]spiperone (7), [11C]methylspiperone ([11C]NMSP), and [18F]setoperone [PubMed], for positron emission tomography (8) imaging. However, none of these ligands has proven to be specific for 5-HT2A receptors because these compounds also bind to other receptors, such as dopamine receptors and the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivative related to ketanserin, was reported to be a potent antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors with >100-fold selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (9, 10). This led to the development of 3-{2-[4-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl}-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([18F]altanserin) as a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging in vivo (11). 5-HT2A antagonists bind to the total pool of receptors, whereas 5-HT2A agonists bind only to the high-affinity functional state of the receptor but may be more important in disease states because the high affinity sites are the ones that transmit the intracellular signals. Furthermore, 2-(4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine ([11C]CIMBI-5), a potent and selective 5-HT2A agonist, has been shown to have similar cortical binding potentials as compared with [18F]altanserin in the pigs using the simplified reference tissue model (12). 2-(4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine ([11C]CIMBI-36), a bromo analog of [11C]CIMBI-5, has also been developed as a tool for studying 5-HT2A agonist binding in the brain (13).',\n",

We have recently shown that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced cytotoxicity in cultured astrocytes and neurons. However, there is no in vivo evidence suggesting the role of NCX in neurodegenerative disorders associated with NO. NO is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. This study examined the effect of SEA0400, the specific NCX inhibitor, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, a model of Parkinson's disease, in C57BL/6J mice. MPTP treatment (10 mg/kg, four times at 2-h intervals) decreased dopamine levels in the midbrain and impaired motor coordination, and these effects were counteracted by S-methylthiocitrulline, a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor. SEA0400 protected against the dopaminergic neurotoxicity (determined by dopamine levels in the midbrain and striatum, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra and striatum, striatal dopamine release, and motor deficits) in MPTP-treated mice. SEA0400 had no radical-scavenging activity. SEA0400 did not affect MPTP metabolism and MPTP-induced NO production and microglial activation, while it attenuated MPTP-induced increases in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation product, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance. These findings suggest that SEA0400 protects against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity probably by blocking ERK phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation which are downstream of NCX-mediated Ca(2+) influx.\",\n",

Each element contains a bipartite promoter for RNA polymerase III, a poly(A) tract located between the monomers, a 3'-terminal poly(A) tract, and numerous CpG islands, and is flanked by short direct repeats. Alu repeats comprise more than 10% of the human genome and are capable of retroposition. Possibly, these elements played an important part in genome evolution. Insertion of an Alu element into a functionally important genome region or other Alu-dependent alterations of gene functions cause various hereditary disorders and are probably associated with carcinogenesis. In total, 14 Alu families differing in diagnostic mutations are known. Some of these, which are present in the human genome, are polymorphic and relatively recently inserted into new loci. Alu copies transposed during ethnic divergence of the human population are useful markers for evolutionary genetic studies.\",\n",
              "  '[Factors associated with achievement and durability of cytogenetic response in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib]. BACKGROUND/AIM: Imatinib mesylate, a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has revolutionized the treatment of Bcr-Abl positive chronic myeloid leukemia and become the standard of care for this disease. The aim of this study was evaluation and analysis of cytogenetic response in different intervals and risk groups as well as finding association between pre-treatment characteristics and later probability of achievement of major cytogenetic response. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 22 adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia positive early chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia treated at our institution from June 2006 to December 2009. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for patients during treatment with imatinib was 25.7 months (range, 12-42 months). A complete hematologic response was achieved in all of the analyzed patients within 6 months from the start of the treatment. The major cytogenetic response rate was 81.8%, and the complete cytogenetic response rate was 72.7%. The patients with low or moderate relative risk had the rate of complementary achieving major and complete cytogenetic response of 75-90%. A multivariate analysis identified the following independent prognostic factors for achieving major cytogenetic response: the absence of splenomegaly, white blood cell count less than 10 x 10(9)/L, the platelet count less than 450 x 10(9)/L, the presence of less than 5% of bone marrow blasts and basophils, the absence of blasts in peripheral blood, the presence of less than 7% of basophils in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: Patients who early achieve complete and major cytogenetic response as well as those with low and moderate relative risk have a higher rate of achieving and maintaining complete cytogenetic response. There are also characteristics of patients before treatment that may indicate the treatment outcome.',\n",
              "  'Use of flumazenil in intoxicated patients with coma. A double-blind placebo-controlled study in ICU. In a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective clinical trial we studied the efficacy and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. In 23 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). In the remaining 7 patients, needing two series of injections of flumazenil (up to 2.0 mg), GCS did not rise significantly and coma was related to intoxications with nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, flunitrazepam and in one patient, encephalitis. In the 10 patients receiving placebo, the GCS did not change. A significant increase in the GCS from 5.5 to 10.8 (p less than 0.001) was, however, observed when flumazenil (up to 1.0 mg) was given after placebo. In patients with EEG monitoring the changes in waveform pattern paralleled the clinical response. Effects could be detected within 1-2 min after flumazenil injection and lasted up to 45 min. There were no adverse reactions or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. The use of flumazenil is of diagnostic value in mixed-drug intoxications or coma of unknown origin and is of therapeutic importance for reversal of benzodiazepine intoxications.',\n",
              "  'Prognostic impact of central nervous system metastases after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI: poorer prognosis associated with T790M-negative status and leptomeningeal metastases. AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic impact of central nervous system metastases (CNS) after acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We defined CNS-collapse as death due to uncontrolled and progressive CNS metastases. Post-progression survival (PPS) after initial TKI failure and T790M status were retrospectively compared in 92 patients with or without CNS collapse. RESULTS: The median PPS in 32 patients with CNS-collapse (16.7 months) was significantly shorter than that of 60 without (26.8 months) (p=0.0002). T790M was detected in four (12%) out of the 32 CNS-collapse patients and in 26 (43%) out of 60 without (p=0.0026). Median PPS in 39 patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) (11.4 months) was significantly shorter versus 53 without (26.8 months) (p=0.0006). The median PPS was 25.1 months in 40 patients with brain metastases and 11.2 months in 52 without (p=0.0387). T790M was detected in 4/5 resected brain tumors (80%) and in 1/26 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples (4%) (p=0.0008). CONCLUSION: CNS-collapse represented poorer prognosis, which was associated with T790M-negative status and LM. Controlling CNS metastases, especially LM, is important to achieve longer survival.',\n",
              "  'Bacillus anthracis virulence regulator AtxA: oligomeric state, function and CO(2) -signalling. AtxA, a unique regulatory protein of unknown molecular function, positively controls expression of the major virulence genes of Bacillus anthracis. The 475 amino acid sequence of AtxA reveals DNA binding motifs and regions similar to proteins associated with the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS). We used strains producing native and functional epitope-tagged AtxA proteins to examine protein-protein interactions in cell lysates and in solutions of purified protein. Co-affinity purification, non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and bis(maleimido)hexane (BMH) cross-linking experiments revealed AtxA homo-multimers. Dimers were the most abundant species. BMH cross-links available cysteines within 13 Å. To localize interaction sites, six AtxA mutants containing distinct Cys→Ser substitutions were tested for multimerization and cross-linking. All mutants multimerized, but one mutation, C402S, prevented cross-linking. Thus, BMH uses C402 to make the inter-molecular bond between AtxA proteins, but C402 is not required for protein-protein interaction. C402 is in a region bearing amino acid similarity to Enzyme IIB proteins of the PTS. The AtxA EIIB motif may function in protein oligomerization. Finally, cultures grown with elevated CO(2) /bicarbonate exhibited increased AtxA dimer/monomer ratios and increased AtxA activity, relative to cultures grown without added CO(2) /bicarbonate, suggesting that this host-associated signal enhances AtxA function by shifting the dimer/monomer equilibrium towards the dimeric state.',\n",
              "  'Phase II trial of syncopated thalidomide, lenalidomide, and weekly dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. UNLABELLED: Thalidomide and lenalidomide, in combination with dexamethasone, provide response rates ranging from 63%-79% after 4 cycles of therapy. Because of toxicities such as neuropathy and myelosuppression for thalidomide and lenalidomide, respectively, dose escalation has not been pursued. We evaluated a syncopated regimen of alternating weeks of thalidomide and lenalidomide to determine if a modified schedule allows for fewer dose reductions and, subsequently, superior efficacy. Although well tolerated, this phase II trial did not show superior efficacy compared with conventional dosing and scheduling of these agents. INTRODUCTION: Over the past decade, the novel agents thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib have emerged as effective treatment in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Initially used in the relapse setting, these agents have been incorporated into frontline treatment algorithms. They have been combined in doublets with corticosteroids, in triplets with alkylators, or with each other. Because thalidomide and lenalidomide have different clinical activity and toxicity profiles, we designed a trial to evaluate a syncopated schedule of thalidomide and lenalidomide with weekly dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed MM to determine response and toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients with newly diagnosed MM were treated with syncopated thalidomide (200 mg on days 1-7 and 15-21), lenalidomide (25 mg on days 8-14 and 22-28 for the first cycle and 50 mg on the same schedule for subsequent cycles) with weekly dexamethasone (40 mg). Each cycle lasted 28 days. MM parameters were assessed at the end of each cycle. It was intended that the patients proceed to stem cell mobilization and autologous transplantation after 4 cycles of therapy. RESULTS: The median number of cycles administered was 3.5. The overall response was 68%. The regimen was well tolerated by the majority of the patients; only patient discontinued treatment because of toxicity. CONCLUSION: We conclude that a syncopated schedule of thalidomide and lenalidomide with weekly dexamethasone was tolerated well, with no unexpected toxicities. However the response rate, even using lenalidomide at 50 mg, was not superior to standard dosing of thalidomide or lenalidomide plus dexamethasone.',\n",

              "  \"McLeod neuroacanthocytosis: genotype and phenotype. McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations of XK, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function. Originally defined as a peculiar Kell blood group variant, the disease affects multiple organs, including the nervous system, but is certainly underdiagnosed. We analyzed the mutations and clinical findings of 22 affected men, aged 27 to 72 years. Fifteen different XK mutations were found, nine of which were novel, including the one of the eponymous case McLeod. Their common result is predicted absence or truncation of the XK protein. All patients showed elevated levels of muscle creatine phosphokinase, but clinical myopathy was less common. A peripheral neuropathy with areflexia was found in all but 2 patients. The central nervous system was affected in 15 patients, as obvious from the occurrence of seizures, cognitive impairment, psychopathology, and choreatic movements. Neuroimaging emphasized the particular involvement of the basal ganglia, which was also detected in 1 asymptomatic young patient. Most features develop with age, mainly after the fourth decade. The resemblance of McLeod syndrome with Huntington's disease and with autosomal recessive chorea-acanthocytosis suggests that the corresponding proteins--XK, huntingtin, and chorein--might belong to a common pathway, the dysfunction of which causes degeneration of the basal ganglia.\",\n",
              "  'A new cardioprotective agent, JTV519, improves defective channel gating of ryanodine receptor in heart failure. Defective interaction between FKBP12.6 and ryanodine receptors (RyR) is a possible cause of cardiac dysfunction in heart failure (HF). Here, we assess whether the new cardioprotective agent JTV519 can correct it in tachycardia-induced HF. HF was induced in dogs by 4-wk rapid ventricular pacing, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was isolated from left ventricular muscles. In failing SR, JTV519 increased the rate of Ca(2+) release and [(3)H]ryanodine binding. RyR were then labeled in a site-directed fashion with the fluorescent conformational probe methylcoumarin acetamide. In failing SR, the polylysine induced a rapid change in methylcoumarin acetamide fluorescence, presumably because the channel opening preceding the Ca(2+) release was smaller than in normal SR (consistent with a decreased rate of Ca(2+) release in failing SR), and JTV519 increased it. In conclusion, JTV519, a new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, corrected the defective channel gating in RyR (increase in both the rapid conformational change and the subsequent Ca(2+) release rate) in HF.',\n",
              "  'Expression of DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalities such as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, developmental abnormality of fin muscle, disorganization of facial musculature and/or degeneration of trunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant localization of myogenic cells marked with α-actin promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside somite boundary, especially in head region. These abnormalities were rescued by coinjection of the short form of DUX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, even at extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FSHD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also propose that DUX4 expression during development is important for the pathogenesis of FSHD.',\n",
              "  'Restless leg syndrome: is it a real problem? Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition that is frequently unrecognized, misdiagnosed and poorly managed. It is characterized by uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs developing at rest that compel the person to move; symptoms are worst at night and sleep disturbance is common. RLS occurs in 7%-11% of the population in Western countries, and many such people experience troublesome symptoms. Primary RLS is familial in up to two thirds of patients. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain. RLS is very responsive to dopaminergic therapies. Rebound of RLS symptoms during the early morning and development of severe symptoms earlier in the day (augmentation) are problematic in those treated for a prolonged period with levodopa. Consequently, dopamine agonists have become first line treatment. Anti-convulsant medications and opioids are helpful in some patients. Correction of underlying problem wherever possible is important in the management of secondary RLS.',\n",

Lack of specific antidotes is a major concern in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) related to direct anticoagulants including dabigatran (OAC-ICH). We examined the efficacy of idarucizumab, an antibody fragment binding to dabigatran, in a mouse model of OAC-ICH. Dabigatran etexilate (DE) dose-dependently prolonged diluted thrombin time and tail-vein bleeding time, which were reversed by idarucizumab. Pretreatment with DE increased intracerebral hematoma volume and cerebral hemoglobin content. Idarucizumab in equimolar dose prevented excess hematoma expansion for both DE doses. In more extensive ICH, idarucizumab significantly reduced mortality. Thus, idarucizumab prevents excess intracerebral hematoma formation in mice anticoagulated with dabigatran and reduces mortality.',\n",
              "  'Phenotypic characterization of endometrial stromal sarcoma of the uterus. Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) of the uterus is a rare uterine malignancy that has not been characterized in detail. To characterize the phenotype of ESS of the uterus, we extracted RNA from ESS and the stroma of normal endometrium using a tissue microdissection system and compared the expression profiles in the two tissues. After suppression subtractive hybridization and differential screening, we detected the metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT-1) gene as one of the major genes upregulated in ESS, and a full-length placental cDNA clone (CS0DI066YJ10) as one of the major genes downregulated. The results were confirmed by in situ hybridization in four resected specimens of ESS and 36 biopsy specimens of normal endometrial tissue. All ESS (4/4) and all cases of endometrial stromal cells in the proliferative phase (13/13) were positive for MALAT-1, but samples of normal stroma in the secretory phase and menopausal state included some that were negative or weakly positive for MALAT-1 (5/13 and 3/10, respectively). In contrast, all ESS and 12 of 13 cases of stromal cells in the proliferative phase were negative for the full-length placental cDNA clone but 10 of 13 cases of endometrial stromal cells in the secretory phase were positive for transcripts of the gene (P < 0.05). These results indicated that endometrial stromal cells have different phenotypic characteristics between proliferative and secretory phases and the tumor cells of ESS have the phenotypic character of endometrial stromal cells in the proliferative phase.',\n",
              "  'Bach1 as a regulator of mitosis, beyond its transcriptional function. Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor which modulates several critical transcriptional responses, such as the expression of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene in response to oxidative stress. In our recent study, we found that Bach1 possesses a novel role in mitotic chromosome alignment during metaphase. Upon BACH1 depletion in HeLa cells, mitotic chromosomes become unstable. This defect was efficiently rescued by expressing Bach1 fragments that lack the DNA binding domain, indicating that its function in mitosis involves a transcription-independent mechanism. The nuclear export signal (NES/CLS) of Bach1 is required for the mitotic function. Bach1 is excluded from the mitotic chromosomes depending on its NES/CLS and the nuclear exporter Crm1. Our findings suggest that Bach1 might mediate the regulation of mitotic chromosomes under conditions of cellular stress.',\n",
              "  'Flumazenil in benzodiazepine antagonism. Actions and clinical use in intoxications and anaesthesiology. In anaesthesia and in the intensive care unit, benzodiazepines have proven safe and effective agents for the induction and maintenance of sedation for a variety of therapeutic goals. However, in these contexts, or in benzodiazepine overdose, it is often desirable to be able to terminate or interrupt sedation without waiting for the effect of the benzodiazepine to become dissipated by normal metabolism and excretion. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. It acts by displacing other benzodiazepines from the receptor site by competitive inhibition. The onset of effect after intravenous administration occurs within 1 to 3 minutes. The optimal dosage is determined for each patient by a dose titration procedure and lies in the range 0.2 to 1.0mg in anaesthesiology, and 0.1 to 2.0mg in intensive care use. Despite its short elimination half-life of around 1 hour, after general anaesthesia or conscious to moderate sedation for short procedures, a single dose of flumazenil is usually sufficient to attain and maintain the desired level of consciousness. After intoxication with high benzodiazepine doses, the duration of effect of a single dose of flumazenil is not expected to exceed 1 hour. In such cases, the period of wakefulness can be prolonged as necessary by repeated low intravenous doses of flumazenil or by infusion (0.1 mg/hour). Flumazenil is well tolerated both systemically and locally. The only adverse events seen with greater frequency after flumazenil compared with placebo were nausea and/or vomiting after general anaesthesia, although the incidence of actual vomiting was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Since these effects were virtually absent in studies of intensive care patients and after sedation for short procedures, and were not seen in tolerability studies in healthy volunteers receiving intravenous bolus doses of up to 100mg, there may be a link between these symptoms and the other agents used in general anaesthesia, some of which have well-known emetic properties. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, either alone or in combination with other agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",
              "  'Dysregulation of the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin and p27Kip1 Promotes Intimal Hyperplasia in Diabetes Mellitus. The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the intima of an artery, known as intimal hyperplasia, is an important component of cardiovascular diseases. This is seen most clearly in the case of in-stent restenosis, where drug eluting stents are used to deliver agents that prevent VSMC proliferation and migration. One class of agents that are highly effective in the prevention of in-stent restenosis is the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Inhibition of mTOR blocks protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, and cell migration. Key to the effects on cell cycle progression and cell migration is the inhibition of mTOR-mediated degradation of p27Kip1 protein. p27Kip1 is a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that is elevated in quiescent VSMCs and inhibits the G1 to S phase transition and cell migration. Under normal conditions, vascular injury promotes degradation of p27Kip1 protein in an mTOR dependent manner. Recent reports from our lab suggest that in the presence of diabetes mellitus, elevation of extracellular signal response kinase activity may promote decreased p27Kip1 mRNA and produce a relative resistance to mTOR inhibition. Here we review these findings and their relevance to designing treatments for cardiovascular disease in the presence of diabetes mellitus.',\n",
              "  'Detailed mechanistic analysis of gevokizumab, an allosteric anti-IL-1β antibody with differential receptor-modulating properties. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is implicated in many autoinflammatory disorders, but is also important in defense against pathogens. Thus, there is a need to safely and effectively modulate IL-1β activity to reduce pathology while maintaining function. Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1β antibody being developed as a treatment for diseases in which IL-1β has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1β signaling through an allosteric mechanism. Because IL-1β signaling is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple components, it is important to understand the kinetics of IL-1β signaling and the impact of gevokizumab on this process. In the present study, we measured the impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1β system using Schild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both of which demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of IL-1β for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling receptor, but not the IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II). Gevokizumab inhibits both the binding of IL-1β to IL-1RI and the subsequent recruitment of IL-1 accessory protein primarily by reducing the association rates of these interactions. Based on this information and recently published structural data, we propose that gevokizumab decreases the association rate for binding of IL-1β to its receptor by altering the electrostatic surface potential of IL-1β, thus reducing the contribution of electrostatic steering to the rapid association rate. These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1β-associated autoinflammatory diseases.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether transvaginal ultrasound measurement of bladder wall thickness can be used as a screening test for detrusor instability in women with urinary symptoms. DESIGN: A blinded prospective study. SETTING: A London teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and eight-four symptomatic women presenting to a urodynamic clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The detection of detrusor instability by means of videocystourethrography (VCU) and ambulatory urodynamics in women with a mean bladder wall thickness of greater than 5 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound. RESULTS: One hundred and eight women had a mean bladder wall thickness of greater than 5 mm. Ninety-four percent (102) of these women had detrusor instability either when undergoing VCU or ambulatory urodynamics. Seventeen women had a bladder wall thickness of less than 3.5 mm of whom three were found to have detrusor instability on VCU. CONCLUSION: The measurement of a mean bladder wall thickness greater than 5 mm with transvaginal ultrasound is a sensitive screening method for diagnosing detrusor instability in symptomatic women without outflow obstruction.',\n",
              "  \"Molecular characterization of the breakpoints of a 12-kb deletion in the NF1 gene in a family showing germ-line mosaicism. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is caused by deletions, insertions, translocations, and point mutations in the NF1 gene, which spans 350 kb on the long arm of human chromosome 17. Although several point mutations have been described, large molecular abnormalities have rarely been characterized in detail. We describe here the molecular breakpoints of a 12-kb deletion of the NF1 gene, which is responsible for the NF1 phenotype in a kindred with two children affected because of germline mosaicism in the unaffected father, who has the mutation in 10% of his spermatozoa. The mutation spans introns 31-39, removing 12,021 nt and inserting 30 bp, of which 19 bp are a direct repetition of a sequence located in intron 31, just 4 bp before the 5' breakpoint. The 5' and 3' breakpoints contain the sequence TATTTTA, which could be involved in the generation of the deletion. The most plausible explanation for the mechanism involved in the generation of this 12-kb deletion is homologous/nonhomologous recombination. Since sperm of the father does not contain the corresponding insertion of the 12-kb deleted sequence, this deletion could have occurred within the NF1 chromosome through loop formation. RNA from lymphocytes of one of the NF1 patients showed similar levels of the mutated and normal transcripts, suggesting that the NF1-mRNA from mutations causing frame shifts of the reading frame or stop codons in this gene is not degraded during its processing. The mutation was not detected in fresh lymphocytes from the unaffected father by PCR analysis, supporting the case for true germ-line mosaicism.\",\n",
              "  'Characterisation of inflammatory response, coagulation, and radiological findings in Katayama fever: a report of three cases at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. BACKGROUND: Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. infection. It is predominantly reported in travellers from non-endemic regions. Whereas the immunological response to Schistosoma infection is well characterised, alterations in inflammatory markers and coagulation in response to acute infection are poorly understood. METHODS: Here we report the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of three returning travellers with Katayama fever. Inflammatory markers and coagulation status were assessed repeatedly during follow-up to characterise the host response to infection. Radiographic findings were correlated with clinical and laboratory markers. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms were suggestive of a significant inflammatory response in all patients including high fever (>39°C), cough, and general malaise. Classical inflammatory markers including blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A were only moderately elevated. Marked eosinophilia (33-42% of white blood cells) was observed and persisted despite anti-inflammatory and anthelminthic treatment for up to 32 weeks. Analysis of blood coagulation markers indicated increased coagulability reflected by elevated D-dimer values (0.57-1.17 μg/ml) and high thrombin generating potentials (peak thrombin activity: 311-384 nM). One patient showed particularly high levels of microparticle-associated tissue factor activity at initial presentation (1.64 pg/ml). Multiple pulmonary and hepatic opacities demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) scanning were associated with raised inflammatory markers in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The characterisation of the inflammatory response, blood coagulation parameters and radiological findings in three patients adds to our current understanding of Katayama fever and serves as a starting point for further systematic investigations of the pathophysiology of this acute helminthic infection.',\n",
              "  \"BTB and CNC homolog 1 (Bach1) deficiency ameliorates TNBS colitis in mice: role of M2 macrophages and heme oxygenase-1. BACKGROUND: BTB and CNC homolog 1 (Bach1) is a transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which plays an important role in the protection of cells and tissues against acute and chronic inflammation. However, the role of Bach1 in the gastrointestinal mucosal defense system remains little understood. HO-1 supports the suppression of experimental colitis and localizes mainly in macrophages in colonic mucosa. This study was undertaken to elucidate the Bach1/HO-1 system's effects on the pathogenesis of experimental colitis. METHODS: This study used C57BL/6 (wild-type) and homozygous Bach1-deficient C57BL/6 mice in which colonic damage was induced by the administration of an enema of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Subsequently, they were evaluated macroscopically, histologically, and biochemically. Peritoneal macrophages from the respective mice were isolated and analyzed. Then, wild-type mice were injected with peritoneal macrophages from the respective mice. Acute colitis was induced similarly. RESULTS: TNBS-induced colitis was inhibited in Bach1-deficient mice. TNBS administration increased the expression of HO-1 messenger RNA and protein in colonic mucosa in Bach1-deficient mice. The expression of HO-1 mainly localized in F4/80-immunopositive and CD11b-immunopositive macrophages. Isolated peritoneal macrophages from Bach1-deficient mice highly expressed HO-1 and also manifested M2 macrophage markers, such as Arginase-1, Fizz-1, Ym1, and MRC1. Furthermore, TNBS-induced colitis was inhibited by the transfer of Bach1-deficient macrophages into wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of Bach1 ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis. Bach1-deficient macrophages played a key role in protection against colitis. Targeting of this mechanism is applicable to cell therapy for human inflammatory bowel disease.\",\n",
              "  'The duration of pacing-induced atrial fibrillation is reduced in vivo by inhibition of small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased morbidity and is in addition the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia. Compounds used in pharmacological treatment has traditionally been divided into Na(+) channel inhibitors, β-blockers, K(+) channel inhibitors, and Ca(2+) channel inhibitors, whereas newer multichannel blockers such as amiodarone and ranolazine have been introduced later. This study was devoted to the evaluation of an acute pacing-induced in vivo model of AF in rats. Antiarrhythmic effects of well-known compounds such as lidocaine, dofetilide, and ranolazine were confirmed in this model. In addition, antiarrhythmic effects of different inhibitors of Ca(2+)-activated small conductance K(+) (SK) channels were demonstrated. Intravenous application of 5 mg/kg of the negative SK channel modulator NS8593 reduced AF duration by 64.5%, and the lowest significantly effective dose was 1.5 mg/kg. A dose-effect relationship was established based on 6 different dose groups. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the antiarrhythmic effect of NS8593 and other tested drugs was associated with an increase in atrial effective refractory period. The functional role of SK channels was confirmed by 2 other SK channel inhibitors, UCL1684 and apamin, thereby confirming the hypothesis that these channels might constitute a new promising target for antiarrhythmic treatment.',\n",
              "  'Daratumumab and its potential in the treatment of multiple myeloma: overview of the preclinical and clinical development. Despite the recent major advancement in therapy for multiple myeloma, it remains an incurable disease. There remains an unmet need for novel therapies that target different mechanisms of action. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies is a promising area of development and will expand our therapeutic armamentarium in the fight against myeloma. Daratumumab is a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human monoclonal antibody against unique CD38 epitope with broad-spectrum killing activity. It has a favorable safety profile as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma and also demonstrates significant single-agent activity. Abundant preclinical data supports its use in combination therapy and clinical studies on various exciting combinations are underway. This review focuses on the CD38 antigen and its targeting with daratumumab and provides an update on the results of recent clinical studies involving daratumumab.',\n",
              "  'Assessment of pain and itch behavior in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1. UNLABELLED: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is characterized primarily by tumor formation in the nervous system, but patients report other neurological complications including pain and itch. Individuals with NF1 harbor 1 mutated NF1 allele causing heterozygous expression in all of their cells. In mice, Nf1 heterozygosity leads to hyperexcitability of sensory neurons and hyperproliferation of mast cells, both of which could lead to increased hypersensitivity and scratching in response to noxious and pruritic stimuli. To determine whether Nf1 heterozygosity may increase pain and itch behaviors independent of secondary effects of tumor formation, we used mice with a targeted, heterozygous Nf1 gene deletion (Nf1±) that lack tumors. Nf1± mice exhibited normal baseline responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli. Moreover, similar to wild-type littermates, Nf1± mice developed inflammation-induced heat\\xa0and mechanical hypersensitivity, capsaicin-induced nocifensive behavior, histamine-dependent or -independent scratching, and chronic constriction injury-induced cold allodynia. However, Nf1±\\xa0mice exhibited an attenuated first phase of formalin-induced spontaneous behavior and expedited resolution of formalin-induced heat hypersensitivity. These results are not consistent with the hypothesis that Nf1 heterozygosity alone is sufficient to increase pain and itch sensation in mice, and they suggest that additional mechanisms may underlie reports of increased pain and itch in NF1 patients. PERSPECTIVE: This study assessed whether Nf1 heterozygosity in mice increased hypersensitivity and scratching following noxious and pruritic stimuli. Using Nf1± mice lacking tumors, this study finds no increases in pain or itch behavior, suggesting that there is no predisposition for either clinical symptom solely due to Nf1 heterozygosity.',\n",
              "  'The S-methylmethionine cycle in angiosperms: ubiquity, antiquity and activity. Angiosperms synthesize S-methylmethionine (SMM) from methionine (Met) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in a unique reaction catalyzed by Met S-methyltransferase (MMT). SMM serves as methyl donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine, catalyzed by homocysteine S-methyltransferase (HMT). MMT and HMT together have been proposed to constitute a futile SMM cycle that stops the free Met pool from being depleted by an overshoot in AdoMet synthesis. Arabidopsis and maize have one MMT gene, and at least three HMT genes that belong to two anciently diverged classes and encode enzymes with distinct properties and expression patterns. SMM, and presumably its cycle, must therefore have originated before dicot and monocot lineages separated. Arabidopsis leaves, roots and developing seeds all express MMT and HMTs, and can metabolize [35S]Met to [35S]SMM and vice versa. The SMM cycle therefore operates throughout the plant. This appears to be a general feature of angiosperms, as digital gene expression profiles show that MMT and HMT are co-expressed in leaves, roots and reproductive tissues of maize and other species. An in silico model of the SMM cycle in mature Arabidopsis leaves was developed from radiotracer kinetic measurements and pool size data. This model indicates that the SMM cycle consumes half the AdoMet produced, and suggests that the cycle serves to stop accumulation of AdoMet, rather than to prevent depletion of free Met. Because plants lack the negative feedback loops that regulate AdoMet pool size in other eukaryotes, the SMM cycle may be the main mechanism whereby plants achieve short-term control of AdoMet level.',\n",
              "  'Biosynthesis and intracellular targeting of the CLN3 protein defective in Batten disease. Batten disease (juvenile-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, JNCL), the most common neurodegenerative disorder of childhood, is caused by mutations in a recently identified gene ( CLN3 ) localized to chromosome 16p11.2-12.1. To elucidate the biosynthesis and localization of the CLN3 protein, we expressed CLN3 cDNA in COS-1 and HeLa cell lines. In vitro translation, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses detected an approximately 43 kDa polypeptide. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the CLN3 protein is synthesized as an N -glycosylated single-chain polypeptide, which was not detected in growth medium. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the CLN3 protein is localized to the lysosomal compartment. These results provide evidence that Batten disease can be classified as a member of lysosomal diseases.',\n",

The present study describes in depth a case of Riedel thyroiditis (RT) to clarify its pathogenesis and its putative inclusion in the spectrum of IgG4-related disease. We report the clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features of a case of RT in a 39-year-old white Spanish woman, admitted with a hard goiter and cold nodule in the left thyroid lobe. This case represents 0.05 % of a series of 1,973 consecutive thyroidectomies performed in our hospital. More than 80 % of the left thyroid lobe was effaced by fibrosis and inflammation (lymphocytes, 57 IgG4+ plasma cells per 1 high-power field, an IgG4/IgG ratio of 0.67, and eosinophils) with extension into the surrounding tissues and occlusive phlebitis. Immunostaining for podoplanin (D2-40) detected signs of increased lymphangiogenesis in the fibroinflammatory areas that were confirmed by electron microscopy. A strong, diffuse stain for podoplanin and transforming growth factor ß1 was also detected in the same areas. The increased number of lymphatic vessels in RT is reported for the first time. Our findings support the inclusion of RT within the spectrum of IgG4-related thyroid disease (IgG4-RTD). Although the etiology and physiopathology of IgG4-RTD still remain elusive, the results obtained in the present case suggest the participation of lymphatic vessels in the pathogenesis of RT.',\n",
              "  \"Abnormal distribution of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor/alpha-synuclein in Lewy body disease as revealed by proteinase K and formic acid pretreatment. The precursor of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP) (also known as alpha-synuclein) is a presynaptic terminal molecule that abnormally accumulates in the plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the Lewy bodies (LBs) of Lewy body variant of AD, diffuse Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease. To better understand the distribution of NACP/alpha-synuclein and its fragments in the LB-bearing neurons and neurites, as well as to clarify the patterns of NACP/alpha-synuclein compartmentalization, we studied NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity using antibodies against the C-terminal, N-terminal, and NAC regions after Proteinase K and formic acid treatment in the cortex of patients with LBs. Furthermore, studies of the subcellular localization of NACP/alpha-synuclein within LB-bearing neurons were performed by immunogold electron microscopy. These studies showed that the N-terminal antibody immunolabeled the LBs and dystrophic neurites with great intensity and, to a lesser extent, the synapses. In contrast, the C-terminal antibody strongly labeled the synapses and, to a lesser extent, the LBs and dystrophic neurites. Whereas Proteinase K treatment enhanced NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity with the C-terminal antibody, it diminished the N-terminal NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. Furthermore, formic acid enhanced LB and dystrophic neurite labeling with both the C- and N-terminal antibodies. In addition, whereas without pretreatment only slight anti-NAC immunoreactivity was found in the LBs, formic acid pretreatment revealed an extensive anti-NAC immunostaining of LBs, plaques, and glial cells. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed within the amorphous electrodense material in the LBs and as small clusters in the filaments of LBs and neurites. These results support the view that aggregated NACP/alpha-synuclein might play an important role in the pathogenesis of disorders associated with LBs.\",\n",
              "  \"Regional cerebral glucose metabolism after pridopidine (ACR16) treatment in patients with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVES: Huntington disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder resulting in loss of motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions and is characterized by a distinctive pattern of cerebral metabolic abnormalities. Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients with Huntington disease. Clinical assessments were performed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Statistical parametric mapping analysis showed increased metabolic activity in several brain regions such as the precuneus and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus after treatment. In addition, after pridopidine treatment, the correlation between the clinical status and the cerebral metabolic activity was strengthened. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes in brain regions implicated as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease. In addition, the finding of a strong relationship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern.\",\n",
              "  \"Effect of opicapone and entacapone upon levodopa pharmacokinetics during three daily levodopa administrations. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opicapone is a novel third generation catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to compare the levodopa pharmacokinetic profile throughout a day driven by the COMT inhibition either following repeated doses of opicapone or concomitant administration with entacapone. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, gender-balanced, parallel-group study was performed in 4 groups of 20 healthy subjects each. Four subjects in each group received placebo during the entire study. Sixteen subjects in one group received placebo once daily for 11 days and on day 12, 200 mg entacapone concomitantly with each levodopa/carbidopa dose (three times separated by a 5-h interval). Sixteen subjects in each of the remaining three groups received respectively 25, 50, and 75 mg opicapone once daily for 11 days and on day 12, placebo concomitantly with each levodopa/carbidopa dose. RESULTS: Levodopa minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) for each levodopa/carbidopa dose and for the mean of all levodopa/carbidopa doses increased substantially with all active treatments (entacapone and opicapone) when compared to the control group (placebo), with values ranging from 1.7-fold (200 mg entacapone) to 3.3-fold (75 mg opicapone). No statistical difference was found for levodopa peak of systemic exposure (as assessed by maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)) between all active treatments and placebo. A significant increase in the levodopa extent of systemic exposure (as assessed by concentration-time curve (AUC)) occurred with all opicapone treatments in relation to placebo. No statistical difference was found for levodopa AUC when entacapone was compared to placebo. When compared to entacapone, both 50 and 75 mg opicapone presented a significant increase for the levodopa AUC. All active treatments significantly inhibited both peak (as assessed by Emax) and extent (as assessed by effect-time curve (AUEC)) of the COMT activity in relation to placebo. When compared to entacapone, all opicapone treatments significantly decreased the extent (AUEC) of the COMT activity due to a long-lasting and sustained effect. The tolerability profile was favorable for all active treatments. CONCLUSION: Opicapone, a novel third generation COMT inhibitor, when compared to entacapone, provides a superior response upon the bioavailability of levodopa associated to more pronounced, long-lasting, and sustained COMT inhibition. The tolerability profile was favorable. On the basis of the results presented in this study and along with the earlier pharmacology studies, it is anticipated that opicapone adjunct therapy at the dosages of 25 and 50 mg will provide an enhancement in levodopa availability that will translate into clinical benefit for Parkinson's disease patients.\",\n",
              "  'Elotuzumab enhances natural killer cell activation and myeloma cell killing through interleukin-2 and TNF-α pathways. Elotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-F7 (SLAMF7, also known as CS1, CD319, or CRACC) that enhances natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of SLAMF7-expressing myeloma cells. This study explored the mechanisms underlying enhanced myeloma cell killing with elotuzumab as a single agent and in combination with lenalidomide, to support ongoing phase III trials in patients with relapsed/refractory or newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). An in vitro peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL)/myeloma cell co-culture model was developed to evaluate the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide. Expression of activation markers and adhesion receptors was evaluated by flow cytometry, cytokine expression by Luminex and ELISPOT assays, and cytotoxicity by myeloma cell counts. Elotuzumab activated NK cells and promoted myeloma cell death in PBL/myeloma cell co-cultures. The combination of elotuzumab plus lenalidomide demonstrated superior anti-myeloma activity on established MM xenografts in vivo and in PBL/myeloma cell co-cultures in vitro than either agent alone. The combination enhanced myeloma cell killing by modulating NK cell function that coincided with the upregulation of adhesion and activation markers, including interleukin (IL)-2Rα expression, IL-2 production by CD3(+)CD56(+) lymphocytes, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. In co-culture assays, TNF-α directly increased NK cell activation and myeloma cell death with elotuzumab or elotuzumab plus lenalidomide, and neutralizing TNF-α decreased NK cell activation and myeloma cell death with elotuzumab. These results demonstrate that elotuzumab activates NK cells and induces myeloma cell death via NK cell-mediated ADCC, which is further enhanced when combined with lenalidomide.',\n",

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in Canada with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the predominant form of the disease. Tumor characterization can identify cancer-driving mutations as treatment targets. One of the most successful examples of cancer targeted therapy is inhibition of mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which occurs in ~10-30% of NSCLC patients. While this treatment has benefited many patients with activating EGFR mutations, almost all who initially benefited will eventually acquire resistance. Approximately 50% of cases of acquired resistance (AR) are due to a secondary T790M mutation in exon 20 of the EGFR gene; however, many of the remaining mechanisms of resistance are still unknown. Much work has been done to elucidate the remaining mechanisms of resistance. This review aims to highlight both the mechanisms of resistance that have already been identified in patients and potential novel mechanisms identified in preclinical models which have yet to be validated in the patient settings.',\n",
              "  'Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy family studies of DUX4 expression: evidence for disease modifiers and a quantitative model of pathogenesis. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), the most prevalent myopathy afflicting both children and adults, is predominantly associated with contractions in the 4q35-localized macrosatellite D4Z4 repeat array. Recent studies have proposed that FSHD pathology is caused by the misexpression of the DUX4 (double homeobox 4) gene resulting in production of a pathogenic protein, DUX4-FL, which has been detected in FSHD, but not in unaffected control myogenic cells and muscle tissue. Here, we report the analysis of DUX4 mRNA and protein expression in a much larger collection of myogenic cells and muscle biopsies derived from biceps and deltoid muscles of FSHD affected subjects and their unaffected first-degree relatives. We confirmed that stable DUX4-fl mRNA and protein were expressed in myogenic cells and muscle tissues derived from FSHD affected subjects, including several genetically diagnosed adult FSHD subjects yet to show clinical manifestations of the disease in the assayed muscles. In addition, we report DUX4-fl mRNA and protein expression in muscle biopsies and myogenic cells from genetically unaffected relatives of the FSHD subjects, although at a significantly lower frequency. These results establish that DUX4-fl expression per se is not sufficient for FSHD muscle pathology and indicate that quantitative modifiers of DUX4-fl expression and/or function and family genetic background are determinants of FSHD muscle disease progression.',\n",

              "  'Phospholamban phosphorylation by CaMKII under pathophysiological conditions. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) transports Ca2+ into the SR, decreasing the cytosolic Ca2+ during relaxation and increasing the SR Ca2+ available for contraction. SERCA2a activity is regulated by phosphorylation of another SR protein: Phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN inhibits SERCA2a. Phosphorylation of PLN by either cAMP or cGMP-dependent protein kinase at Ser16 or the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), at Thr17, relieves this inhibition, increasing SR Ca2+ uptake and SR Ca2+ load. Thus, PLN is a major player in the regulation of myocardial relaxation and contractility. This review will examine the main aspects of the role of CaMKII and Thr17 site of PLN, on different pathophysiological conditions: acidosis, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and heart failure (HF). Whereas CaMKII-activation and PLN phosphorylation contribute to the functional recovery during acidosis and stunning, CaMKII results detrimental in the irreversible I/R injury, producing apoptosis and necrosis. Phosphorylation of Thr17 residue of PLN and CaMKII activity vary in the different models of HF. The possible role of these changes in the depressed cardiac function of HF will be discussed.',\n",

In prosecution of an anti-Flaviviridae project a new series of variously substituted 2-diphenyl-benzimidazoles were synthesized and tested in vitro for antiviral and antiproliferative activities. Compounds were tested in cell-based assays against viruses representative of: i) two of the three genera of the Flaviviridae family, i.e. Flaviviruses and Pestiviruses; ii) other RNA virus families, such as Retroviridae, Picornaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Reoviridae; iii) two DNA virus families (Herpesviridae and Poxviridae). The 5-Acetyl-2-(4'-nitrobiphenyl-4-yl)-1H-benzimidazole (24) emerged as potent active lead compound against Yellow Fever Virus (a Flavivirus) (EC(50) = 0.5 microM) and CVB-2 at 1 microM and was not cytotoxic, whereas the other title benzimidazoles showed no antiviral activity at concentrations not cytotoxic for the resting cell monolayers. Among the examined series, the most cytotoxic derivatives (11,12,14,16,18,19,20,21,23,25-30) against mock-infected MT-4 cells (CC50 < 8.0 microM) were evaluated against a panel of human cell lines derived from haematological and solid tumours,using 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and etoposide as reference drugs. In particular, compounds 26 and 28 showed a similar potency of 6-MP and etoposide.\",\n",
              "  \"The immunopathogenesis of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis one century after hashimoto. Hakaru Hashimoto described 4 patients with a hitherto unknown cause for goitre, struma lymphomatosa, a century ago. He was careful to distinguish this from Riedel thyroiditis but it has become clear that fibrosis and atrophy of the thyroid are indeed components of Hashimoto thyroiditis, and in rare cases IgG4-related sclerosing disease may be an outcome. Although the cause of the lymphocytic infiltration was unknown to Hashimoto, we now know through the pioneering studies of N.R. Rose and E. Witebsky [J Immunol 1956;76:417-427] that this condition is the archetype for autoimmune destruction as a disease mechanism. In the last two decades in particular, there has been huge interest in unravelling the genetic basis for this and related autoimmune disorders. The list of polymorphisms associated with autoimmune thyroid disease grows each year, and in the case of vitiligo, which is frequently found in association with thyroid autoimmunity, we know that 27 separate susceptibility loci account for less than 20% of the heritability of this condition. Environmental and existential factors may turn out to be just as complex in number and in interactions. We can thus imagine a 'Swiss cheese' model for the causation of autoimmune thyroid disease, in which the effects of cumulative weaknesses line up - like the holes in slices of cheese - to allow the catastrophic event of autoimmune destruction to occur.\",\n",
              "  'Beneficial effects of propylthiouracil plus L-thyroxine treatment in a patient with a mutation in MCT8. CONTEXT: Mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene determine a distinct X-linked phenotype of severe psychomotor retardation and consistently elevated T(3) levels. Lack of MCT8 transport of T(3) in neurons could explain the neurological phenotype. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether the high T(3) levels could also contribute to some critical features observed in these patients. RESULTS: A 16-yr-old boy with severe psychomotor retardation and hypotonia was hospitalized for malnutrition (body weight = 25 kg) and delayed puberty. He had tachycardia (104 beats/min), high SHBG level (261 nmol/liter), and elevated serum free T(3) (FT(3)) level (11.3 pmol/liter), without FT(4) and TSH abnormalities. A missense mutation of the MCT8 gene was present. Oral overfeeding was unsuccessful. The therapeutic effect of propylthiouracil (PTU) and then PTU plus levothyroxine (LT(4)) was tested. After PTU (200 mg/d), serum FT(4) was undetectable, FT(3) was reduced (3.1 pmol/liter) with high TSH levels (50.1 mU/liter). Serum SHBG levels were reduced (72 nmol/liter). While PTU prescription was continued, high LT(4) doses (100 microg/d) were needed to normalize serum TSH levels (3.18 mU/liter). At that time, serum FT(4) was normal (16.4 pmol/liter), and FT(3) was slightly high (6.6 pmol/liter). Tachycardia was abated (84 beats/min), weight gain was 3 kg in 1 yr, and SHBG was 102 nmol/liter. CONCLUSIONS: 1) When thyroid hormone production was reduced by PTU, high doses of LT(4) (3.7 microg/kg.d) were needed to normalize serum TSH, confirming that mutation of MCT8 is a cause of resistance to thyroid hormone. 2) High T(3) levels might exhibit some deleterious effects on adipose, hepatic, and cardiac levels. 3) PTU plus LT(4) could be an effective therapy to reduce general adverse features, unfortunately without benefit on the psychomotor retardation.',\n",

Oral pregabalin, a calcium channel alpha(2)delta-subunit ligand with analgesic, anxiolytic and antiepileptic activity, has shown efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia. It has a multidimensional effect in the treatment of this complex condition, and is associated with rapid and clinically significant improvements in several outcome measures relating to core symptoms of the syndrome, including pain and sleep, in patients with long-standing fibromyalgia. Pregabalin treatment is also associated with improvements in the overall health status of these patients. The beneficial effects of pregabalin are durable in patients with an initial response to the drug. The most common adverse events associated with the drug are dizziness and somnolence, which are generally mild to moderate in intensity and are tolerated by many patients.

Human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells are believed to express the antigens responsible for the production of pathological antibodies in the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), a Ca2+ channel disorder in which quantal transmitter release from the motor nerve terminal is impaired. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used to study the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels expressed by H146 SCLC cells and the effects of LES antibodies on these channels. The types of Ca2+ channels were determined using biophysical properties and pharmacological sensitivity to several antagonists. 2. Whole-cell Ca2+ currents (ICa) in SCLC cells are sensitive to the dihydropyridine (DHP) nicardipine, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX GVIA) and omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-AgTX IVA). Nicardipine at 100 nM and 10 microM reduced ICa by 35 and 45% (n = 38 cells), respectively, while omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) inhibited ICa by 32% (n = 31). Application of omega-AgTX IVA at 50 and 100 nM to the cancer cells decreased ICa by 41 and 42%, respectively (n = 22). 3. Measurement of cell membrane capacitance (Cm) revealed that Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis underlies the secretory activity of SCLC cells. Exocytosis, when induced by step depolarizing pulses and measured by increases in Cm, was markedly inhibited by nicardipine (10 microM) and omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM). In contrast, omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) was not as effective in altering increases in Cm. 4. From negative (-80 mV) and depolarized (-40 mV) holding potentials, both peak and plateau ICa were inhibited by the presence of LES antibodies (1 mg ml-1 IgG). LES serum also reduced depolarization-induced increases in Cm by 48% (n = 15). 5. To determine whether the LES antibodies are downregulating a specific type(s) of Ca2+ channel, nicardipine (10 microM), omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) or omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM) was applied to tumour cells that had been previously exposed to LES serum for 24 h. The most pronounced change was that omega-AgTX IVA was 38-84% less effective at reducing ICa after the IgG treatment. The effectiveness of nicardipine was diminished by 18% after incubation with the LES antibodies, whereas the omega-CgTX GVIA was seen to be more effective. These results suggest that LES IgG downregulates P-type Ca2+ channels and, possibly, to a lesser extent L-type channels. 6. In view of recent evidence that P-type Ca2+ channels mediate cholinergic transmitter release at the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the expression of P-type Ca2+ channels in the SCLC cells and the reactivity of LES IgG with these channels support the hypothesis that P-type Ca2+ channels in these cancer cells may trigger the autoantibody production in this disorder. The antibodies so produced are implicated in the functional impairment of the Ca2+ channels characteristic of LES.',\n",
              "  'Genetic ablation of the transcription repressor Bach1 leads to myocardial protection against ischemia/reperfusion in mice. Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase-1 gene (Hmox-1) and beta-globin gene. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is an inducible cytoprotective enzyme that degrades pro-oxidant heme to carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin/bilirubin, which are thought to mediate anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant actions of HO-1. In the present study, we investigated the role of Bach1 in tissue protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vivo using mice lacking the Bach1 gene (Bach1(-/-)) and wild-type (Bach1(+/+)) mice. In Bach1(-/-) mice, myocardial expression of HO-1 protein was constitutively up-regulated by 3.4-fold compared to that in Bach1(+/+) mice. While myocardial I/R induced HO-1 protein in ischemic myocytes in both strains of mice, the extent of induction was significantly greater in Bach1(-/-) mice than in Bach1(+/+) mice. Myocardial infarction was markedly reduced in size by 48.4% in Bach1(-/-) mice. Pretreatment of Bach1(-/-) mice with zinc-protoporphyrin, an inhibitor of HO activity, abolished the infarction-reducing effect of Bach1 disruption, indicating that reduction in the infarct size was mediated, at least in part, by HO-1 activity. Thus, Bach1 plays a pivotal role in setting the levels of both constitutive and inducible expression of HO-1 in the myocardium. Bach1 inactivation during I/R appears to be a key mechanism controlling the activation level of cytoprotective program involving HO-1.',\n",
              "  'The promoter of mouse transcription repressor bach1 is regulated by Sp1 and trans-activated by Bach1. The Maf recognition element (MARE) is regulated by both activators and repressors. Bach1 and Bach2 repress MARE-dependent transcription by forming heterodimers with Maf-related oncoproteins. In order to gain an understanding of the regulation of bach1 gene expression, we analyzed the structure of the mouse bach1 gene. Comparison of the exon-intron structure of the bach1 gene with those of other NF-E2-related genes indicated that bach1 and bach2 constitute an evolutionarily distinct subfamily among bZip factors. The bach1 promoter region contains two GC boxes that are important for its basal activity and are bound by Sp1 in K562 cell extracts. In addition, we found an evolutionarily conserved MARE-like element located downstream of the transcription initiation site. Deletion of this element resulted in a higher promoter activity in K562 cells. Bach1 trans-activated its own promoter depending on the presence of the MARE-like element in co-transfection assays. However, Bach1 did not bind to the MARE-like element in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). These results suggest that Bach1 activates its own promoter indirectly by inhibiting the putative repressor. Such a positive feedback regulation by the repressor Bach1 may play an important role in maintaining the expression of Bach1 while consolidating repression of other genes with MARE.',\n",

Mice deficient in Bach1 (Bach1-/-), a transcriptional repressor of the HO-1 and beta-globin genes, express high levels of HO-1 mRNA and protein in various organs. The authors hypothesized that HO-1 modulates the secondary injury process after SCI in Bach1(-/-) mice. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 (wild-type) and homozygous Bach1(-/-) C57BL/6 mice were subjected to moderate SCI, and differences in hindlimb motor function, and electrophysiological, molecular biological, and histopathological changes were assessed for 2 weeks. RESULTS: Functional recovery was greater, and motor evoked potentials were significantly larger in Bach1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice throughout the observation period. The expression of HO-1 mRNA in the spinal cord was significantly increased in both mice until 3 days after injury, and it was significantly higher in Bach1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice at every assessment point. Histological examination using Luxol fast blue staining at 1 day after injury showed that the injured areas were smaller in Bach1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. The HO-1 immunoreactivity was not detected in uninjured spinal cord, but 3 days postinjury the number of HO-1-immunoreactive cells was obviously higher in the injured area in both mice, particularly in Bach1(-/-) mice. The HO-1 was primarily induced in microglia/macrophage in both mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that HO-1 modulates the secondary injury process, and high HO-1 expression may preserve spinal cord function in the early stages after SCI in Bach1(-/-) mice. Treatment that induces HO-1 expression at these early stages may preserve the functional outcome after SCI.',\n",
              "  'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) mutations occur rarely in sporadic parathyroid adenomas. CONTEXT: The molecular pathogenesis of primary hyperparathyroidism is still largely unknown. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene has a major role in the pathogenesis of familial isolated pituitary adenoma. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the involvement of the AIP gene in sporadic parathyroid adenomas. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: We performed direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analyses of the AIP gene in a large series of sporadic parathyroid adenomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the AIP locus was studied, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein immunostaining was also performed. In addition, alterations in the MEN1 gene were studied. RESULTS: A somatic AIP mutation, substitution of arginine with glutamine at codon 304 (R304Q), was identified in 2 of 132 tumors. The mutation was germline in both cases despite the nonfamilial presentation. Heterozygous AIP large deletions were detected in 29 cases including 1 of the 2 mutated tumors, confirming a biallelic inactivation of the AIP gene. The AIP-mutated tumor with LOH showed decreased AIP immunostaining compared with normal parathyroid. LOH at the MEN1 locus, which often shared LOH at the AIP locus, was found in one third of tumors. Somatic MEN1 mutations were found in the 1 of the 2 AIP-mutated tumors and in 22 parathyroid adenomas. In addition, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis revealed 1 large deletion of the MEN1 gene in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: The AIP gene is rarely involved in parathyroid adenomas, but the germline nature of the mutations suggests that it might predispose to primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN1 gene alterations occur in a substantial proportion of sporadic parathyroid adenomas.',\n",

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of empagliflozin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 4-week, multiple dose, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients (n\\xa0=\\xa0100) were randomized to receive 1, 5, 10 or 25\\xa0mg of empagliflozin, or placebo once daily. Key end-points were urinary glucose excretion (UGE), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and eight-point glucose profile. RESULTS: Data are presented for 1, 5, 10, 25\\xa0mg of empagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day\\xa027 in UGE were 40.8, 77.1, 80.9, 93.0 and -2.1\\xa0g (P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001 for all empagliflozin groups vs placebo).

              "  'Proteolytic activation cascade of the Netherton syndrome-defective protein, LEKTI, in the epidermis: implications for skin homeostasis. Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) is the defective protein of the ichthyosiform condition Netherton syndrome (NS). Strongly expressed in the most differentiated epidermal layers, LEKTI is a serine protease inhibitor synthesized as three different high-molecular-weight precursors, which are rapidly processed into shorter fragments and secreted extracellularly. LEKTI polypeptides interact with several proteases to regulate skin barrier homeostasis as well as inflammatory and/or immunoallergic responses. Here, by combining antibody mapping, N-terminal sequencing, and site-specific mutagenesis, we defined the amino-acid sequence of most of the LEKTI polypeptides physiologically generated in human epidermis. We also identified three processing intermediates not described so far. Hence, a proteolytic cascade model for LEKTI activation is proposed. We then pinpointed the most effective fragments against the desquamation-related kallikreins (KLKs) and we proved that LEKTI is involved in stratum corneum shedding as some of its polypeptides inhibit the KLK-mediated proteolysis of desmoglein-1. Finally, we quantified the individual LEKTI fragments in the uppermost epidermis, showing that the ratios between LEKTI polypeptides and active KLK5 are compatible with a fine-tuned inhibition. These findings are relevant both to the understanding of skin homeostasis regulation and to the design of novel therapeutic strategies for NS.',\n",

Flumazenil, a potent benzodiazepine antagonist, is a newly synthetic imidazo-benzodiazepine, which blocks the neurological effects of benzodiazepines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of this agent in reversal of benzodiazepine overdose and differentiation of comatous patients with drug overdose. Fifteen comatous patients with suspected sedatives/hypnotics overdose were included in this study and flumazenil 0.25 mg per dose was administrated intravenously. The average score of Glasgow Coma Scale increased from 7.13 +/- 2.92 to 10.93 +/- 3.67 after one dose of flumazenil. Clear consciousness was restored after multiple doses of flumazenil administration. Three cases with different drug history and variant response after flumazenil treatment were also illustrated and discussed. The dosage of flumazenil used in this study ranged from 0.25 mg to 3 mg (average 0.87 +/- 0.74 mg). We concluded that flumazenil is an excellent antidote for benzodiazepine overdose and valuable for differentiating the patients in comatose.',\n",
              "  'Novel vaccine peptide GV1001 effectively blocks β-amyloid toxicity by mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. GV1001 is a 16-amino-acid vaccine peptide derived from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence. We investigated the effects of GV1001 against β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in rat neural stem cells (NSCs). Primary culture NSCs were treated with several concentrations of GV1001 and/or Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer for 48 hours. GV1001 protected NSCs against the Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in a concentration-dependent manner. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ concentration dependently decreased viability, proliferation, and mobilization of NSCs and GV1001 treatment restored the cells to wild-type levels. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ increased free radical levels in rat NSCs while combined treatment with GV1001 significantly reduced these levels. In addition, GV1001 treatment of Aβ₂₅₋₃₅-injured NSCs increased the expression level of survival-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated survival proteins, and decreased the levels of death and inflammation-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated death proteins. Together, these results suggest that GV1001 possesses neuroprotective effects against Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in NSCs and that these effects are mediated through mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, including the induction of cellular proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects, mitochondrial stabilization, and anti-aging and anti-oxidant effects.',\n",
              "  'The Nedd8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 thwarts microenvironment-driven NF-κB activation and induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells. BACKGROUND: Stromal-mediated signaling enhances NF-κB pathway activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, leading to cell survival and chemoresistance. Ubiquitination of IκBα may partially account for constitutive activation of NF-κB. MLN4924 is an investigational agent that inhibits the Nedd8-activating enzyme, thereby neutralizing Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases and preventing degradation of their substrates. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a preclinical assessment of MLN4924 in CLL. Primary CLL cells were cocultured in vitro with CD40L-expressing stroma to mimic the prosurvival conditions present in lymphoid tissue. The effect of MLN4924 on CLL cell apoptosis, NF-κB pathway activity, Bcl-2 family members, and cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry, Western blotting, PCR, and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: CD40L-expressing stroma protected CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis and induced resistance to multiple drugs, accompanied by NF-κB activation and Bim repression. Treatment with MLN4924 induced CLL cell apoptosis and circumvented stroma-mediated resistance. This was accompanied by accumulation of phospho-IκBα, decreased nuclear translocation of p65 and p52 leading to inhibition of both the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways, and reduced transcription of their target genes, notably chemokines. MLN4924 promoted induction of Bim and Noxa in the CLL cells leading to rebalancing of Bcl-2 family members toward the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bim or Noxa decreased sensitivity to MLN4924. MLN4924 enhanced the antitumor activity of the inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BCR)-associated kinases. CONCLUSIONS: MLN4924 disrupts NF-κB activation and induces Bim expression in CLL cells, thereby preventing stroma-mediated resistance. Our data provide rationale for further evaluation of MLN4924 in CLL.',\n",
              "  'DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) mutation affects Snrpn imprinting in the mouse male germ line. DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases are essential for spermatogenesis. Mutations in the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 gene exert a paternal effect on epigenetic states and phenotypes of offspring, suggesting that DNMT1 is important for the epigenetic remodeling of the genome that takes place during spermatogenesis. However, the specific role of DNMT1 in spermatogenesis and the establishment of genomic imprints in the male germ line remains elusive. To further characterize the effect of DNMT1 deficiency on the resetting of methylation imprints during spermatogenesis, we analyzed the methylation profiles of imprinted regions in the spermatozoa of mice that were heterozygous for a Dnmt1 loss-of-function mutation. The mutation did not affect the H19 or IG differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that are usually highly methylated but led to a partial hypermethylation of the Snrpn DMR, a region that should normally be unmethylated in mature spermatozoa. This defect does not appear in mouse models with mutations in Dnmt3a and Mthfr genes and, therefore, it is specific for the Dnmt1 gene and is suggestive of a role of DNMT1 in imprint resetting or maintenance in the male germ line.',\n",
              "  'A common FGFR3 gene mutation is present in achondroplasia but not in hypochondroplasia. Achondroplasia is the most common type of genetic dwarfism. It is characterized by disproportionate short stature and other skeletal anomalies resulting from a defect in the maturation of the chondrocytes in the growth plate of the cartilage. Recent studies mapped the achondroplasia gene on chromosome region 4p16.3 and identified a common mutation in the gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). In an analysis of 19 achondroplasia families from a variety of ethnic backgrounds we confirmed the presence of the G380R mutation in 21 of 23 achondroplasia chromosomes studied. In contrast, the G380R mutation was not found in any of the 8 hypochondroplasia chromosomes studied. Furthermore, linkage studies in a 3-generation family with hypochondroplasia show discordant segregation with markers in the 4p16.3 region suggesting that at least some cases of hypochondroplasia are caused by mutations in a gene other than FGFR3.',\n",
              "  'First deep intronic mutation in the NOTCH3 gene in a family with late-onset CADASIL. CADASIL is the most prominent inherited form of vascular dementia. The main clinical features include migraine with aura, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline, with a mid-life (30s-60s) adult onset. Genetic testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis. CADASIL is caused mostly by missense mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, invariably involving a cysteine residue. Only a couple of splice site mutations have been reported. In a few pathologically defined patients, genetic mutations remain unidentified. We report a family with late-onset CADASIL phenotype carrying a novel intronic deletion in the NOTCH3 gene (c.341-26_24delAAC). Transcript analysis revealed a splicing alteration, with the complete intron 3 retention. The insertion was in-frame and encoded an extra 25 amino acids, including 1 cysteine. This is the first report of an aberrant splicing event of the NOTCH3 gene associated with a mutation far away from the canonical splice site. Our finding suggests that the assays used to evaluate splicing should be mandatory in the diagnostic setting of genetically undefined CADASIL cases.',\n",
              "  \"Diagnosis and characterization of presymptomatic patients with Wilson's disease and the use of molecular genetics to aid in the diagnosis. Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation leading to liver and/or brain damage. Although fatal if untreated, the condition can be treated effectively. Autosomal recessive inheritance indicates that siblings of affected patients are at 25% risk of having the disease. If they are diagnosed prior to becoming symptomatic, affected siblings can be kept free of symptoms by prophylactic therapy. In this paper we have examined the utility of copper-related variables, along with other clinical and molecular findings, in identifying those siblings of affected patients who should be further evaluated with a liver biopsy. Data are presented on a series of 13 presymptomatic patients in whom we have made the diagnosis of WD based on liver biopsy findings. Signs of liver disease were present in 12 out of 13 cases. The classic, noninvasive, screening approaches that we evaluated were not adequate to identify all cases of WD in this group of patients. These included positive Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings, elevated liver serum alanine transferase, elevated urine copper, or elevated plasma nonceruloplasmin copper. We have introduced the use of molecular genetics for screening siblings of affected patients for WD. We show that a probe from the linked retinoblastoma (RB) gene can be very helpful in problem cases. However, at this time, the quantitative determination of liver copper concentration remains as the definitive diagnostic criterion.\",\n",
              "  'Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in healthy male volunteers: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1 trial. BACKGROUND: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity in a 1:1 molar ratio. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of increasing doses of idarucizumab for the reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in a two-part phase 1 study (rising-dose assessment and dose-finding, proof-of-concept investigation). Here we present the results of the proof-of-concept part of the study. METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, proof-of-concept phase 1 study, we enrolled healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years) with a body-mass index of 18·5-29·9 kg/m(2) into one of four dose groups at SGS Life Sciences Clinical Research Services, Belgium. Participants were randomly assigned within groups in a 3:1 ratio to idarucizumab or placebo using a pseudorandom number generator and a supplied seed number. Participants and care providers were masked to treatment assignment. All participants received oral dabigatran etexilate 220 mg twice daily for 3 days and a final dose on day 4. Idarucizumab (1 g, 2 g, or 4 g 5-min infusion, or 5 g plus 2·5 g in two 5-min infusions given 1 h apart) was administered about 2 h after the final dabigatran etexilate dose. The primary endpoint was incidence of drug-related adverse events, analysed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of dabigatran etexilate. Reversal of diluted thrombin time (dTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT) were secondary endpoints assessed by measuring the area under the effect curve from 2 h to 12 h (AUEC2-12) after dabigatran etexilate ingestion on days 3 and 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01688830. FINDINGS: Between Feb 23, and Nov 29, 2013, 47 men completed this part of the study. 12 were enrolled into each of the 1 g, 2 g, or 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab groups (nine to idarucizumab and three to placebo in each group), and 11 were enrolled into the 4 g idarucizumab group (eight to idarucizumab and three to placebo). Drug-related adverse events were all of mild intensity and reported in seven participants: one in the 1 g idarucizumab group (infusion site erythema and hot flushes), one in the 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab group (epistaxis); one receiving placebo (infusion site haematoma), and four during dabigatran etexilate pretreatment (three haematuria and one epistaxis). Idarucizumab immediately and completely reversed dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in a dose-dependent manner; the mean ratio of day 4 AUEC2-12 to day 3 AUEC2-12 for dTT was 1·01 with placebo, 0·26 with 1 g idarucizumab (74% reduction), 0·06 with 2 g idarucizumab (94% reduction), 0·02 with 4 g idarucizumab (98% reduction), and 0·01 with 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab (99% reduction). No serious or severe adverse events were reported, no adverse event led to discontinuation of treatment, and no clinically relevant difference in incidence of adverse events was noted between treatment groups. INTERPRETATION: These phase 1 results show that idarucizumab was associated with immediate, complete, and sustained reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in healthy men, and was well tolerated with no unexpected or clinically relevant safety concerns, supporting further testing. Further clinical studies are in progress. FUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG.',\n",

              "  'Additional phenotypic features of Muenke syndrome in 2 Dutch families. In about 30% of the patients with syndromal craniosynostosis, a genetic mutation can be traced. For the purpose of adequate genetic counseling and treatment of these patients, the full spectrum of clinical findings for each specific mutation needs to be appreciated. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. A number of studies on the relationship between genotype and phenotype concerning this specific mutation have been published. Two Dutch families with Muenke syndrome were screened for the reported characteristics of this syndrome and for additional features. New phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow, fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome. Because Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already made in a family member.',\n",
              "  'Crystal structure of the human OX2 orexin receptor bound to the insomnia drug suvorexant. The orexin (also known as hypocretin) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) respond to orexin neuropeptides in the central nervous system to regulate sleep and other behavioural functions in humans. Defects in orexin signalling are responsible for the human diseases of narcolepsy and cataplexy; inhibition of orexin receptors is an effective therapy for insomnia. The human OX2 receptor (OX2R) belongs to the β branch of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, and can bind to diverse compounds including the native agonist peptides orexin-A and orexin-B and the potent therapeutic inhibitor suvorexant. Here, using lipid-mediated crystallization and protein engineering with a novel fusion chimaera, we solved the structure of the human OX2R bound to suvorexant at 2.5\\xa0Å resolution. The structure reveals how suvorexant adopts a π-stacked horseshoe-like conformation and binds to the receptor deep in the orthosteric pocket, stabilizing a network of extracellular salt bridges and blocking transmembrane helix motions necessary for activation. Computational docking suggests how other classes of synthetic antagonists may interact with the receptor at a similar position in an analogous π-stacked fashion. Elucidation of the molecular architecture of the human OX2R expands our understanding of peptidergic GPCR ligand recognition and will aid further efforts to modulate orexin signalling for therapeutic ends.',\n",
              "  'The specific Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor SEA0400 prevents nitric oxide-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays a role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, causes apoptotic-like cell death in cultured glial cells via NCX-mediated pathways and the mechanism for NO-induced cytotoxicity is cell type-dependent. The present study examined using the specific NCX inhibitor 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) whether NCX is involved in NO-induced injury in cultured neuronal cells. The treatment of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with SNP resulted in apoptosis and the cytotoxicity was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase inhibitor U0126 and the p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580, but not by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP60012. SNP increased Ca(2+) influx and intracellular Ca(2+) levels. In addition, SNP increased ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These effects of SNP were prevented by SEA0400. SNP-induced cytotoxicity was not affected by inhibitors of the Ca(2+), Na(+) and store-operated/capacitative channels. Moreover, SNP-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels, ROS production and decrease in cell viability were blocked by a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor. These results suggest that Ca(2+) influx via the reverse of NCX is involved in the cascade of NO-induced neuronal apoptosis and NO activates the NCX through guanylate cyclase/PKG pathway.',\n",
              "  'Cardiomyocyte ryanodine receptor degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy. AIMS: Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective mechanism for the degradation of soluble cytosolic proteins bearing the sequence KFERQ. These proteins are targeted by chaperones and delivered to lysosomes where they are translocated into the lysosomal lumen and degraded via the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A). Mutations in LAMP2 that inhibit autophagy result in Danon disease characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) plays a key role in cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction and its dysfunction can lead to cardiac failure. Whether RyR2 is degraded by CMA is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: To induce CMA, cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with geldanamycin (GA) to promote protein degradation through this pathway. GA increased LAMP-2A levels together with its redistribution and colocalization with Hsc70 in the perinuclear region, changes indicative of CMA activation. The inhibition of lysosomes but not proteasomes prevented the loss of RyR2. The recovery of RyR2 content after incubation with GA by siRNA targeting LAMP-2A suggests that RyR2 is degraded via CMA. In silico analysis also revealed that the RyR2 sequence harbours six KFERQ motifs which are required for the recognition Hsc70 and its degradation via CMA. Our data suggest that presenilins are involved in RyR2 degradation by CMA. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with a model in which oxidative damage of the RyR2 targets it for turnover by presenilins and CMA, which could lead to removal of damaged or leaky RyR2 channels.',\n",
              "  \"Characterization of a human carcinoma cell line selected for resistance to the farnesyl transferase inhibitor 4-(2-(4-(8-chloro-3,10-dibromo-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo-(5,6)-cyclohepta(1,2-b)-pyridin-11(R)-yl)-1-piperidinyl)-2-oxo-ethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxamide (SCH66336). Farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors (FTIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in certain solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Little is known about mechanisms of resistance to these agents. To provide a basis for better understanding FTI resistance, the colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT 116 was selected by stepwise exposure to increasing 4-(2-(4-(8-chloro-3,10-dibromo-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo-(5,6)-cyclohepta(1,2-b)-pyridin-11(R)-yl)-1-piperidinyl)-2-oxo-ethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxamide (SCH66336) concentrations. The resulting line, HCT 116R, was 100-fold resistant to SCH66336 and other FTIs, including methyl {N-[2-phenyl-4-N[2(R)-amino-3-mercaptopropylamino] benzoyl]}-methionate (FTI-277), but was less than 2-fold resistant to the standard agents gemcitabine, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. Accumulation of the unfarnesylated forms of prelamin A and HDJ-2, two substrates that reflect farnesyl transferase inhibition, was similar in FTI-treated parental and HCT 116R cells, indicating that alterations in drug uptake or inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase is not the mechanism of resistance. Changes in signal-transduction pathways that might account for this resistance were examined by immunoblotting and confirmed pharmacologically. There was no difference in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway or sensitivity to the MEK1/2 inhibitor 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059) in HCT 116R cells. In contrast, increased phosphorylation of the molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream target p70 S6 kinase and increased levels of Akt1 and Akt2 were demonstrated in HCT 116R cells. Further experiments demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin selectively sensitized HCT 116R cells to SCH66336 but not to gemcitabine, cisplatin, or paclitaxel. These findings provide evidence that alterations in the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway can contribute to FTI resistance and suggest a potential strategy for overcoming this resistance.\",\n",
              "  'High incidence of iron depletion and restless leg syndrome (RLS) in regular blood donors: intravenous iron sucrose substitution more effective than oral iron. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Iron depletion is common in regular blood donors. The objective of the study was to investigate the frequency and severity of iron depletion in regular blood donors and whether IV iron is more effective than oral to avoid iron depletion and symptoms thereof, especially restless legs syndrome (RLS). METHOD: One hundred and twenty blood donors with at least five previous whole blood donations were randomized to receive either IV iron sucrose (Venofer(®), RenaPharma/Vifor, Uppsala, Sweden), 200 mg, or to 20×100 mg of oral iron sulphate (Duroferon(®), GlaxoSmithKline, Stockholm, Sweden), after each blood donation during 1 year. Iron status and RLS incidence and severity were investigated. RESULTS: Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%). The IV iron group increased storage iron to a greater extent than the oral iron group after 12 months (P=0·0043). Female donors were more responsive to IV iron sucrose compared to oral iron sulphate, particularly female donors below 50 years of age. RLS severity scores were significantly lower in the IV iron group. The two treatments were safe. CONCLUSION: Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient. IV iron sucrose substitutes iron loss in blood donors more efficiently compared with oral iron sulphate, especially in women.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene is a tumor suppressor gene, and the NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, can downregulate the N-ras gene. Because the N-ras gene is often mutated in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we wondered if the NF1 gene might be mutated in those AML samples not having N-ras mutations. We investigated the mutational status of the N-ras gene and the FLR exon of codons 1371-1423 of the open reading frame of the full-length NF1 cDNA, which has a strong homology with the mammalian ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP), especially for a stretch of three consecutive amino acids (F, L, R), by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing in samples from patients with AML. Of 48 AML patients, 10 (21%) had point (missense) mutations of the N-ras gene involving codons 12, 13 and 61. However, mutations in the FLR exon of the NF1 gene were not detected in any of the AML samples. We also examined the difference of clinical response to induction therapy between AML patients with and without N-ras mutation. A significantly lower rate of complete remission was noted in individuals with N-ras gene mutations. These results suggest that mutation of the NF1 gene, at least in the FLR exon, is very rare in AML and the NF1 gene probably is not a functional complement of the N-ras gene mutation. The presence of N-ras gene mutation may be associated with a lower clinical response to antileukemic therapy.',\n",
              "  'Genetic factors that might lead to different responses in individuals exposed to perchlorate. Perchlorate has been detected in groundwater in many parts of the United States, and recent detection in vegetable and dairy food products indicates that contamination by perchlorate is more widespread than previously thought. Perchlorate is a competitive inhibitor of the sodium iodide symporter, the thyroid cell-surface protein responsible for transporting iodide from the plasma into the thyroid. An estimated 4.3% of the U.S. population is subclinically hypothyroid, and 6.9% of pregnant women may have low iodine intake. Congenital hypothyroidism affects 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 infants, and 15% of these cases have been attributed to genetic defects. Our objective in this review is to identify genetic biomarkers that would help define subpopulations sensitive to environmental perchlorate exposure. We review the literature to identify genetic defects involved in the iodination process of the thyroid hormone synthesis, particularly defects in iodide transport from circulation into the thyroid cell, defects in iodide transport from the thyroid cell to the follicular lumen (Pendred syndrome), and defects of iodide organification. Furthermore, we summarize relevant studies of perchlorate in humans. Because of perchlorate inhibition of iodide uptake, it is biologically plausible that chronic ingestion of perchlorate through contaminated sources may cause some degree of iodine discharge in populations that are genetically susceptible to defects in the iodination process of the thyroid hormone synthesis, thus deteriorating their conditions. We conclude that future studies linking human disease and environmental perchlorate exposure should consider the genetic makeup of the participants, actual perchlorate exposure levels, and individual iodine intake/excretion levels.',\n",
              "  'Strand-specific PCR of UV radiation-damaged genomic DNA revealed an essential role of DNA-PKcs in the transcription-coupled repair. BACKGROUND: In eukaryotic cells, there are two sub-pathways of nucleotide excision repair (NER), the global genome (gg) NER and the transcription-coupled repair (TCR). TCR can preferentially remove the bulky DNA lesions located at the transcribed strand of a transcriptional active gene more rapidly than those at the untranscribed strand or overall genomic DNA. This strand-specific repair in a suitable restriction fragment is usually determined by alkaline gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blotting transfer and hybridization with an indirect end-labeled single-stranded probe. Here we describe a new method of TCR assay based on strand-specific-PCR (SS-PCR). Using this method, we have investigated the role of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinases (PIKK) family, in the TCR pathway of UV-induced DNA damage. RESULTS: Although depletion of DNA-PKcs sensitized HeLa cells to UV radiation, it did not affect the ggNER efficiency of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) damage. We postulated that DNA-PKcs may involve in the TCR process. To test this hypothesis, we have firstly developed a novel method of TCR assay based on the strand-specific PCR technology with a set of smart primers, which allows the strand-specific amplification of a restricted gene fragment of UV radiation-damaged genomic DNA in mammalian cells. Using this new method, we confirmed that siRNA-mediated downregulation of Cockayne syndrome B resulted in a deficiency of TCR of the UV-damaged dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. In addition, DMSO-induced silencing of the c-myc gene led to a decreased TCR efficiency of UV radiation-damaged c-myc gene in HL60 cells. On the basis of the above methodology verification, we found that the depletion of DNA-PKcs mediated by siRNA significantly decreased the TCR capacity of repairing the UV-induced CPDs damage in DHFR gene in HeLa cells, indicating that DNA-PKcs may also be involved in the TCR pathway of DNA damage repair. By means of immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF-Mass spectrometric analysis, we have revealed the interaction of DNA-PKcs and cyclin T2, which is a subunit of the human transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb). While the P-TEFb complex can phosphorylate the serine 2 of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and promote transcription elongation. CONCLUSION: A new method of TCR assay was developed based the strand-specific-PCR (SS-PCR). Our data suggest that DNA-PKcs plays a role in the TCR pathway of UV-damaged DNA. One possible mechanistic hypothesis is that DNA-PKcs may function through associating with CyclinT2/CDK9 (P-TEFb) to modulate the activity of RNA Pol II, which has already been identified as a key molecule recognizing and initializing TCR.',\n",
              "  'Chromosome XII context is important for rDNA function in yeast. The rDNA cluster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is located 450 kb from the left end and 610 kb from the right end of chromosome XII and consists of approximately 150 tandemly repeated copies of a 9.1 kb rDNA unit. To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number. The frequency of silencing of URA3 inserted within the rDNA locus was found to be greater than in a wild-type strain. The localization and morphology of the nucleolus was also affected such that a single and occasionally (6-12% frequency) two foci for Nop1p and a rounded nucleolus were observed, whereas a typical crescent-shaped nucleolar structure was seen in the wild-type strain. Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spans than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles. These observations suggest that the context of chromosome XII plays an important role in maintaining a constant rDNA copy number and in physiological processes related to rDNA function in S.cerevisiae.',\n",
              "  'In UV-irradiated Saccharomyces cerevisiae, overexpression of Swi2/Snf2 family member Rad26 increases transcription-coupled repair and repair of the non-transcribed strand. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) in eukaryotes is a pathway conserved from yeast to humans that removes many bulky chemical adducts and UV-induced photoproducts from DNA in a relatively error-free manner. In addition to the recognition and excision of DNA damage throughout the genome (GGR), there exists a mechanism, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCR), for recognizing some types of DNA damage in the transcribed strand of genes in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells. An obstacle in the repair of the transcribed strand of active genes is the RNA polymerase complex stalled at sites of DNA damage. The stalled RNA polymerase complex may then mediate recruitment of repair proteins to damage in the transcribed strand. Proteins enabling TCR are the Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) protein in humans and its yeast homologue Rad26. Both CSB and Rad26 belong to the Swi2/Snf2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases, which change DNA accessibility to proteins by altering chromatin structure. To address how Rad26 functions in yeast repair, we used the genetic approach of overexpressing Rad26 and examined phenotypic changes, i.e. changes in NER. We found that repair of both the transcribed and the non-transcribed strands is increased. In addition, overexpression of Rad26 partially bypasses the requirement for Rad7 in GGR, specifically in the repair of non-transcribed sequences. As TCR takes place in very localized regions of DNA (i.e. within genes) in wild-type cells, we propose that overexpression of recombinant Rad26 increases accessibility of the damaged DNA in chromatin for interaction with repair proteins.',\n",
              "  'TBC1D7 is a third subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex upstream of mTORC1. The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) tumor suppressors form the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which limits cell growth in response to poor growth conditions. Through its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rheb, this complex inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a key promoter of cell growth. Here, we identify and biochemically characterize TBC1D7 as a stably associated and ubiquitous third core subunit of the TSC1-TSC2 complex. We demonstrate that the TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 (TSC-TBC) complex is the functional complex that senses specific cellular growth conditions and possesses Rheb-GAP activity. Sequencing analyses of samples from TSC patients suggest that TBC1D7 is unlikely to represent TSC3. TBC1D7 knockdown decreases the association of TSC1 and TSC2 leading to decreased Rheb-GAP activity, without effects on the localization of TSC2 to the lysosome. Like the other TSC-TBC components, TBC1D7 knockdown results in increased mTORC1 signaling, delayed induction of autophagy, and enhanced cell growth under poor growth conditions.',\n",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether body mass index (BMI), as a proxy for body fat, influences rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity in a gender-specific manner. METHODS: Consecutive patients with RA were enrolled from 25 countries into the QUEST-RA program between 2005 and 2008. Clinical and demographic data were collected by treating rheumatologists and by patient self-report. Distributions of Disease Activity Scores (DAS28), BMI, age, and disease duration were assessed for each country and for the entire dataset; mean values between genders were compared using Student's t-tests. An association between BMI and DAS28 was investigated using linear regression, adjusting for age, disease duration and country. RESULTS: A total of 5,161 RA patients (4,082 women and 1,079 men) were included in the analyses. Overall, women were younger, had longer disease duration, and higher DAS28 scores than men, but BMI was similar between genders. The mean DAS28 scores increased with increasing BMI from normal to overweight and obese, among women, whereas the opposite trend was observed among men. Regression results showed BMI (continuous or categorical) to be associated with DAS28. Compared to the normal BMI range, being obese was associated with a larger difference in mean DAS28 (0.23, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.34) than being overweight (0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21); being underweight was not associated with disease activity. These associations were more pronounced among women, and were not explained by any single component of the DAS28. CONCLUSIONS: BMI appears to be associated with RA disease activity in women, but not in men.\",\n",
              "  'Cyclophilin D inactivation protects axons in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults, affecting some two million people worldwide. Traditionally, MS has been considered a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the central white matter in which ensuing demyelination results in physical disability [Frohman EM, Racke MK, Raine CS (2006) N Engl J Med 354:942-955]. More recently, MS has become increasingly viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder in which neuronal loss, axonal injury, and atrophy of the CNS lead to permanent neurological and clinical disability. Although axonal pathology and loss in MS has been recognized for >100 years, very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Progressive axonal loss in MS may stem from a cascade of ionic imbalances initiated by inflammation, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic deficits that result in mitochondrial and cellular Ca2+ overload. In a murine disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice lacking cyclophilin D (CyPD), a key regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), developed EAE, but unlike WT mice, they partially recovered. Examination of the spinal cords of CyPD-knockout mice revealed a striking preservation of axons, despite a similar extent of inflammation. Furthermore, neurons prepared from CyPD-knockout animals were resistant to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species thought to mediate axonal damage in EAE and MS, and brain mitochondria lacking CyPD sequestered substantially higher levels of Ca2+. Our results directly implicate pathological activation of the mitochondrial PTP in the axonal damage occurring during MS and identify CyPD, as well as the PTP, as a potential target for MS neuroprotective therapies.',\n",
              "  'Genetics of congenital hypothyroidism. Congenital hypothyroidism is the most common neonatal metabolic disorder and results in severe neurodevelopmental impairment and infertility if untreated. Congenital hypothyroidism is usually sporadic but up to 2% of thyroid dysgenesis is familial, and congenital hypothyroidism caused by organification defects is often recessively inherited. The candidate genes associated with this genetically heterogeneous disorder form two main groups: those causing thyroid gland dysgenesis and those causing dyshormonogenesis. Genes associated with thyroid gland dysgenesis include the TSH receptor in non-syndromic congenital hypothyroidism, and Gsalpha and the thyroid transcription factors (TTF-1, TTF-2, and Pax-8), associated with different complex syndromes that include congenital hypothyroidism. Among those causing dyshormonogenesis, the thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin genes were initially described, and more recently PDS (Pendred syndrome), NIS (sodium iodide symporter), and THOX2 (thyroid oxidase 2) gene defects. There is also early evidence for a third group of congenital hypothyroid conditions associated with iodothyronine transporter defects associated with severe neurological sequelae. This review focuses on the genetic aspects of primary congenital hypothyroidism.',\n",
              "  'Delving into the diversity of facultative heterochromatin: the epigenetics of the inactive X chromosome. X chromosome inactivation represents one of the most dramatic examples of mono-allelic gene expression and long-term gene-silencing in mammals. The key regulatory molecule that triggers silencing is the Xist transcript, but little is known about its repressive action. Some progress has been made in deciphering the epigenetics of the inactive state that it triggers, however. During pre-implantation development, the inactive state is relatively labile. Later on, in the soma, the inactive state is highly stable and clonally heritable. This is ensured by the panoply of epigenetic modifications that characterize the inactive X and, presumably, is also a result of its spatio-temporal segregation. The inactive X chromosome has been associated with an increasing number of histone modifications, and several recent studies have implicated Polycomb group proteins in laying down some of these marks. Thanks to genetic and biochemical approaches to analyse these proteins, the epigenetic tapestry of the inactive X is just beginning to be unravelled. Lineage-specific differences provide a glimpse into the developmental complexity of the epigenetic marks that ensure the inactive state.',\n",
              "  'SERCA in genesis of arrhythmias: what we already know and what is new? This review mainly focuses on the structure, function of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) and its role in genesis of arrhythmias. SERCA is a membrane protein that belongs to the family of P-type ion translocating ATPases and pumps free cytosolic calcium into intracellular stores. Active transport of Ca2+ is achieved, according to the E1-E2 model, changing of SERCA structure by Ca2+. The affinity of Ca2+ -binding sites varies from high (E1) to low (E2). Three different SERCA genes were identified-SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3. SERCA is mainly represented by the SERCA2a isoform in the heart. In heart muscle, during systole, depolarization triggers the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and starts contraction. During diastole, muscle relaxation occurs as Ca2+ is again removed from cytosol, predominantly by accumulation into SR via the action of SERCA2a. The main regulator of SERCA2a is phospholamban and another regulator proteolipid of SERCA is sarcolipin. There are a lot of studies on the effect of decreased and/or increased SERCA activity in genesis of arrhythmia. Actually both decrease and increase of SERCA activity in the heart result in some pathological mechanisms such as heart failure and arrhythmia.',\n",
              "  'Activation of the Nrf2 pathway by inorganic arsenic in human hepatocytes and the role of transcriptional repressor Bach1. Previous studies have proved that the environmental toxicant, inorganic arsenic, activates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in many different cell types. This study tried to explore the hepatic Nrf2 pathway upon arsenic treatment comprehensively, since liver is one of the major target organs of arsenical toxicity. Our results showed that inorganic arsenic significantly induced Nrf2 protein and mRNA expression in Chang human hepatocytes. We also observed a dose-dependent increase of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) luciferase activity. Both the mRNA and protein levels of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were all upregulated dramatically. On the other hand, entry and accumulation of Nrf2 protein in the nucleus, while exportting the transcriptional repressor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) from nucleus to cytoplasm, were also confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Our results therefore confirmed the arsenic-induced Nrf2 pathway activation in hepatocytes and also suggested that the translocation of Bach1 was associated with the regulation of Nrf2 pathway by arsenic. Hepatic Nrf2 pathway plays indispensable roles for cellular defenses against arsenic hepatotoxicity, and the interplay of Bach1 and Nrf2 may be helpful to understand the self-defensive responses and the diverse biological effects of arsenicals.',\n",
              "  'Investigational anticoagulants for hematological conditions: a new generation of therapies. INTRODUCTION: The introduction of novel anticoagulants has had contrasting effects on the agents in the pipeline, fueling the development of some and sinking the others. The complexity of the coagulation cascade offers interesting inhibition choices that might become valid treatment options. AREAS COVERED: This review will highlight some of the anticoagulants in the pipeline. Following the success of the direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors already in the market, new agents are being tested. These include AZD0837, betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, and LY517717. Targeting other components of the hemostatic pathway might lead to better safety profiles without influencing efficacy. Inhibitors to FVIIa-tissue factor (FVIIa/TF) complex, FIX, FXI, and FXII are being assessed. New inspiring inhibitors are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and aptamers. These are highly specific agents with readily reversible effect and might be engineered to inhibit any coagulation factor. Currently tested ASOs and aptamers are inhibitors of FXI, FXII, thrombin, FIXa, and platelet GPIV. EXPERT OPINION: Some of the agents in the pipeline offer valid treatment option for long-term therapy, overcoming some of the drawbacks of the novel anticoagulants. Research is being driven by an expanding market in the anticoagulation field that has been unexploited for a long time.',\n",
              "  'Lipin 2 binds phosphatidic acid by the electrostatic hydrogen bond switch mechanism independent of phosphorylation. Lipin 2 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) responsible for the penultimate step of triglyceride synthesis and dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA) to generate diacylglycerol. The lipin family of PA phosphatases is composed of lipins 1-3, which are members of the conserved haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. Although genetic alteration of LPIN2 in humans is known to cause Majeed syndrome, little is known about the biochemical regulation of its PAP activity. Here, in an attempt to gain a better general understanding of the biochemical nature of lipin 2, we have performed kinetic and phosphorylation analyses. We provide evidence that lipin 2, like lipin 1, binds PA via the electrostatic hydrogen bond switch mechanism but has a lower rate of catalysis. Like lipin 1, lipin 2 is highly phosphorylated, and we identified 15 phosphosites. However, unlike lipin 1, the phosphorylation of lipin 2 is not induced by insulin signaling nor is it sensitive to inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin. Importantly, phosphorylation of lipin 2 does not negatively regulate either membrane binding or PAP activity. This suggests that lipin 2 functions as a constitutively active PA phosphatase in stark contrast to the high degree of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of lipin 1. This knowledge of lipin 2 regulation is important for a deeper understanding of how the lipin family functions with respect to lipid synthesis and, more generally, as an example of how the membrane environment around PA can influence its effector proteins.',\n",
              "  'Characterization of a polymorphism in the coding sequence of FCN3 resulting in a Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen) deficiency state. Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen or H-ficolin) is a soluble pattern recognition molecule in the lectin complement pathway. We speculated whether common genetic variations in the FCN3 gene contribute to deficiency of Ficolin-3. The FCN3 gene was sequenced in 237 healthy Danish Caucasians. The relevance of polymorphisms was assessed with antibodies against Ficolin-3 in a novel ELISA system and by production of recombinant Ficolin-3 variants. Ficolin-3 serum profiles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Ficolin-3 serum concentration varied 10-fold (median, 24microg/ml; range, 3-54microg/ml). Out of several polymorphisms one FCN3+1637delC causing a reading frame shift and a distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule with an allele frequency of 0.011 was particularly interesting. In individuals heterozygous for the FCN3+1637delC deletion lowered Ficolin-3 concentration was observed (P=0.025). SDS-PAGE and western blotting of serum revealed a weak band corresponding to the truncated molecule in addition to the normal Ficolin-3 pattern. Characterization of recombinant Ficolin-3 derived from FCN3+1637delC showed that in the homozygous situation this allelic variant would lead to Ficolin-3 deficiency. In conclusion an FCN3+1637delC deletion variant disrupting the possibility for pattern recognition was detected. Characterization of recombinant variant Ficolin-3 shows that homozygosity for the FCN3+1637delC deletion may lead to Ficolin-3 deficiency and may thus be the basis for a novel complement deficiency state.',\n",
              "  'Xite, X-inactivation intergenic transcription elements that regulate the probability of choice. Allelic expression differences contribute to phenotypic variation. In X chromosome inactivation (XCI), unfavorable XCI ratios promote X-linked disease penetrance in females. During XCI, one X is randomly silenced by Xist. X chromosome choice is determined by asymmetric expression of Tsix whose antisense action represses Xist. Here, we discover a cis element in the mouse X-inactivation center that regulates Tsix. Xite harbors intergenic transcription start sites and DNaseI hypersensitive sites with allelic differences. At the onset of XCI, deleting Xite downregulates Tsix in cis and skews XCI ratios, suggesting that Xite promotes Tsix persistence on the active X. Truncating Xite RNA is inconsequential, indicating that Xite action does not require intact transcripts. We propose that allele-specific Xite action promotes Tsix asymmetry and generates X chromosome inequality. Therefore, Xite is a candidate for the Xce, the classical modifier of XCI ratios.',\n",
              "  'Regulation of RANTES/CCL5 expression in human astrocytes by interleukin-1 and interferon-beta. In the CNS, astrocytes are significant sources of RANTES/CCL5 (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), a CC-chemokine with important biological function. Astrocyte RANTES/CCL5 has been shown to be induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1), with interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) as a primer, but whether type I interferons play any role in the expression of RANTES/CCL5 is not known. In this report, we studied the detailed mechanism of RANTES/CCL5 induction in primary human astrocytes activated with IL-1 and IFNbeta. Ribonuclease protection assay and ELISA showed that IFNbeta, although not effective alone, increased IL-1-induced RANTES/CCL5 expression, but did not antagonize IFNgamma. IL-1 or IL-1/IFNbeta-induced RANTES/CCL5 expression was inhibited by the super-repressor IkappaBalpha or inhibitors of p38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), but not by extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK) inhibitors. IFNbeta enhanced IL-1-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but was not effective alone. Transfection with mutated RANTES/CCL5 promoter-reporter constructs revealed that kappaB, interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and CAATT-enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBPbeta) sites all contributed to IL-1/IFNbeta-induced RANTES/CCL5 transcription. IFNbeta synergized with IL-1 to induce nuclear accumulation of C/EBPbeta protein. They also synergized to form nuclear ISRE complexes with Stat1, Stat2 and interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) proteins. Together, our results demonstrate that IFNbeta plays a positive regulatory role in the expression of RANTES/CCL5 in human astrocytes through several distinct mechanisms.',\n",
              "  'Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking Btn1p modulate vacuolar ATPase activity to regulate pH imbalance in the vacuole. The vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) along with ion channels and transporters maintains vacuolar pH. V-ATPase ATP hydrolysis is coupled with proton transport and establishes an electrochemical gradient between the cytosol and vacuolar lumen for coupled transport of metabolites. Btn1p, the yeast homolog to human CLN3 that is defective in Batten disease, localizes to the vacuole. We previously reported that Btn1p is required for vacuolar pH maintenance and ATP-dependent vacuolar arginine transport. We report that extracellular pH alters both V-ATPase activity and proton transport into the vacuole of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. V-ATPase activity is modulated through the assembly and disassembly of the V(0) and V(1) V-ATPase subunits located in the vacuolar membrane and on the cytosolic side of the vacuolar membrane, respectively. V-ATPase assembly is increased in yeast cells grown in high extracellular pH. In addition, at elevated extracellular pH, S. cerevisiae lacking BTN1 (btn1-Delta), have decreased V-ATPase activity while proton transport into the vacuole remains similar to that for wild type. Thus, coupling of V-ATPase activity and proton transport in btn1-Delta is altered. We show that down-regulation of V-ATPase activity compensates the vacuolar pH imbalance for btn1-Delta at early growth phases. We therefore propose that Btn1p is required for tight regulation of vacuolar pH to maintain the vacuolar luminal content and optimal activity of this organelle and that disruption in Btn1p function leads to a modulation of V-ATPase activity to maintain cellular pH homeostasis and vacuolar luminal content.',\n",
              "  'K-Ras promotes angiogenesis mediated by immortalized human pancreatic epithelial cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Activating point mutations in the K-Ras oncogene are among the most common genetic alterations in pancreatic cancer, occurring early in the progression of the disease. However, the function of mutant K-Ras activity in tumor angiogenesis remains poorly understood. Using human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) and K-Ras4B(G12V)-transformed HPDE (HPDE-KRas) cells, we show that activated K-Ras significantly enhanced the production of angiogenic factors including CXC chemokines and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Western blot analysis revealed that K-Ras activation promoted the phosphorylation of Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1/2 (MEK1/2) and expression of c-Jun. MEK1/2 inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, significantly inhibited the secretion of both CXC chemokines and VEGF, whereas the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 abrogated only CXC chemokine production. To further elucidate the biological functions of oncogenic K-Ras in promoting angiogenesis, we did in vitro invasion and tube formation assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC cocultured with HPDE-KRas showed significantly enhanced invasiveness and tube formation as compared with either control (without coculture) or coculture with HPDE. Moreover, SB225002 (a CXCR2 inhibitor) and 2C3 (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) either alone or in a cooperative manner significantly reduced the degree of both Ras-dependent HUVEC invasiveness and tube formation. Similar results were obtained using another pair of immortalized human pancreatic duct-derived cells, E6/E7/st and its oncogenic K-Ras variant, E6/E7/Ras/st. Taken together, our results suggest that angiogenesis is initiated by paracrine epithelial secretion of CXC chemokines and VEGF downstream of activated oncogenic K-Ras, and that this vascular maturation is in part dependent on MEK1/2 and c-Jun signaling.',\n",

              "  'Hemoprotein Bach1 regulates enhancer availability of heme oxygenase-1 gene. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects cells from various insults including oxidative stress. Transcriptional activators, including the Nrf2/Maf heterodimer, have been the focus of studies on the inducible expression of ho-1. Here we show that a heme-binding factor, Bach1, is a critical physiological repressor of ho-1. Bach1 bound to the multiple Maf recognition elements (MAREs) of ho-1 enhancers with MafK in vitro and repressed their activity in vivo, while heme abrogated this repressor function of Bach1 by inhibiting its binding to the ho-1 enhancers. Gene targeting experiments in mice revealed that, in the absence of Bach1, ho-1 became expressed constitutively at high levels in various tissues under normal physiological conditions. By analyzing bach1/nrf2 compound-deficient mice, we documented antagonistic activities of Bach1 and Nrf2 in several tissues. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that small Maf proteins participate in both repression and activation of ho-1. Thus, regulation of ho-1 involves a direct sensing of heme levels by Bach1 (by analogy to lac repressor sensitivity to lactose), generating a simple feedback loop whereby the substrate effects repressor-activator antagonism.',\n",

Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) was proposed to be part of the disease mechanisms of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We generated a tet-repressible muscle-specific Pitx1 transgenic mouse model which develops phenotypes of muscular dystrophy after the PITX1 expression is induced. In this study, we attempted to block the translation of PITX1 protein using morpholinos. Three groups of the transgenic mice received intravenous injections of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) (100 mg/kg), octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated morpholino (vivo-morpholino) (10 mg/kg), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) after the PITX1 expression was induced. Immunoblotting data showed that PITX1 expression in the triceps and quadriceps was significantly reduced 70% and 63% by the vivo-morpholino treatment, respectively. Muscle pathology of the mice treated with the vivo-morpholino was improved by showing 44% fewer angular-shaped atrophic myofibers. Muscle function determined by grip strength was significantly improved by the vivo-morpholino treatment. The study showed that systemic delivery of the vivo-morpholino reduced the PITX1 expression and improved the muscle phenotypes. Aberrant expression of DUX4 from the last unit of the D4Z4 array has been proposed to be the cause of FSHD. The findings of this study suggest that the same principle may be applied to suppress the aberrantly expressed DUX4 in FSHD.',\n",
              "  'The anti-apoptotic protein HAX-1 is a regulator of cardiac function. The HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that protects cardiomyocytes from programmed cell death. Here we identify HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. Conversely, downregulation of HAX-1 enhanced calcium cycling and contractility. The inhibitory effects of HAX-1 were abolished upon phosphorylation of phospholamban, which plays a fundamental role in controlling basal contractility and constitutes a key downstream effector of the beta-adrenergic signaling cascade. Mechanistically, HAX-1 promoted formation of phospholamban monomers, the active/inhibitory units of the calcium pump. Indeed, ablation of PLN rescued HAX-1 inhibition of contractility in vivo. Thus, HAX-1 represents a regulatory mechanism in cardiac calcium cycling and its responses to sympathetic stimulation, implicating its importance in calcium homeostasis and cell survival.',\n",
              "  'Molecular and cellular bases of chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the overproduction of granulocytes, which leads to high white blood cell counts and splenomegaly in patients. Based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, CML is classified into three clinical phases, often starting with a chronic phase, progressing to an accelerated phase and ultimately ending in a terminal phase called blast crisis. Blast crisis phase of CML is clinically similar to an acute leukemia; in particular, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a severe form of acute leukemia in blast crisis, and there is no effective therapy for it yet. CML is induced by the BCR-ABL oncogene, whose gene product is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. Currently, inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by its kinase inhibitor such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a major therapeutic strategy for CML. However, the inability of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors to completely kill leukemia stem cells (LSCs) indicates that these kinase inhibitors are unlikely to cure CML. In addition, drug resistance due to the development of BCRABL mutations occurs before and during treatment of CML with kinase inhibitors. A critical issue to resolve this problem is to fully understand the biology of LSCs, and to identify key genes that play significant roles in survival and self-renewal of LSCs. In this review, we will focus on LSCs in CML by summarizing and discussing available experimental results, including the original studies from our own laboratory.',\n",
              "  'In vivo Mn-enhanced MRI for early tumor detection and growth rate analysis in a mouse medulloblastoma model. Mouse models have increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor that often forms in the cerebellum. A major goal of ongoing research is to better understand the early stages of tumorigenesis and to establish the genetic and environmental changes that underlie MB initiation and growth. However, studies of MB progression in mouse models are difficult due to the heterogeneity of tumor onset times and growth patterns and the lack of clinical symptoms at early stages. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for noninvasive, longitudinal, three-dimensional (3D) brain tumor imaging in the clinic but is limited in resolution and sensitivity for imaging early MBs in mice. In this study, high-resolution (100 μm in 2 hours) and high-throughput (150 μm in 15 minutes) manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) protocols were optimized for early detection and monitoring of MBs in a Patched-1 (Ptch1) conditional knockout (CKO) model. The high tissue contrast obtained with MEMRI revealed detailed cerebellar morphology and enabled detection of MBs over a wide range of stages including pretumoral lesions as early as 2 to 3 weeks postnatal with volumes close to 0.1 mm(3). Furthermore, longitudinal MEMRI allowed noninvasive monitoring of tumors and demonstrated that lesions within and between individuals have different tumorigenic potentials. 3D volumetric studies allowed quantitative analysis of MB tumor morphology and growth rates in individual Ptch1-CKO mice. These results show that MEMRI provides a powerful method for early in vivo detection and longitudinal imaging of MB progression in the mouse brain.',\n",
              "  'Nf1;Trp53 mutant mice develop glioblastoma with evidence of strain-specific effects. Astrocytomas are the leading cause of brain cancer in humans. Because these tumours are highly infiltrative, current treatments that rely on targeting the tumour mass are often ineffective. A mouse model for astrocytoma would be a powerful tool for dissecting tumour progression and testing therapeutics. Mouse models of astrocytoma have been designed to express oncogenic proteins in astrocytes, but have had limited success due to low tumour penetrance or limited tumour progression. We present here a mouse model of astrocytomas involving mutation of two tumour-suppressor genes, Nf1 and Trp53. Humans with mutations in NF1 develop neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and have increased risk of optic gliomas, astrocytomas and glioblastomas. The TP53 tumour suppressor is often mutated in a subset of astrocytomas that develop at a young age and progress slowly to glioblastoma (termed secondary glioblastomas, in contrast to primary glioblastomas that develop rapidly de novo). This mouse model shows a range of astrocytoma stages, from low-grade astrocytoma to glioblastoma multiforme, and may accurately model human secondary glioblastoma involving TP53 loss. This is the first reported mouse model of astrocytoma initiated by loss of tumour suppressors, rather than overexpression of transgenic oncogenes.',\n",
              "  'Oral IIa and Xa inhibitors for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation: clinical studies and regulatory considerations. Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common, clinically significant, cardiac arrhythmia affects 1% of the general population and has important hemodynamic and thromboembolic complications that contribute to elevated morbidity and mortality. AF increases the overall risk of stroke five-fold, accounting for approximately 15% of all strokes and is associated with particularly severe stroke. For the last 50 years, long-term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists has been the most effective therapy for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF and other risk factors, but their use has a lot of limitations and drawbacks (frequent monitoring and dose adjustment, food and drug interactions, delayed onset of action etc). Nowadays, new oral anticoagulants have emerged that seem to overcome those limitations. Direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have proven, in large, multicenter, randomized, phase III, clinical studies, to be at least as efficient as warfarin in stroke prevention in patients with AF. RELY and ROCKET AF trials have contributed to market approval of dabigatran and rivaroxaban, respectively and made them available to clinical practice. Another factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is under evaluation in an ongoing phase III clinical trial and others such as AZD0837, betrixaban and darexaban are still in safety and tolerability phase II studies. The oral anticoagulation landscape is changing rapidly and these new agents seem to be very promising. However future post-marketing studies and registries will help clarify their efficacy and safety.',\n",
              "  'Seipin promotes adipose tissue fat storage through the ER Ca²⁺-ATPase SERCA. Adipose tissue is central to the regulation of lipid metabolism. Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy type 2 (BSCL2), one of the most severe lipodystrophy diseases, is caused by mutation of the Seipin gene. Seipin plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis, but its exact molecular functions are still unknown. Here, we show that Seipin physically interacts with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in both Drosophila and man. SERCA, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium pump, is solely responsible for transporting cytosolic calcium into the ER lumen. Like dSeipin, dSERCA cell-autonomously promotes lipid storage in Drosophila fat cells. dSeipin affects dSERCA activity and modulates intracellular calcium homeostasis. Adipose tissue-specific knockdown of the ER-to-cytosol calcium release channel ryanodine receptor (RyR) partially restores fat storage in dSeipin mutants. Our results reveal that Seipin promotes adipose tissue fat storage by regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 5 doses of oral tofacitinib (CP-690,550) or adalimumab monotherapy with placebo for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. METHODS: In this 24-week, double-blind, phase IIb study, patients with RA (n = 384) were randomized to receive placebo, tofacitinib at 1, 3, 5, 10, or 15 mg administered orally twice a day, or adalimumab at 40 mg injected subcutaneously every 2 weeks (total of 6 injections) followed by oral tofacitinib at 5 mg twice a day for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the responder rate according to the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) at week 12. RESULTS: Treatment with tofacitinib at a dose of > 3 mg twice a day resulted in a rapid response with significant efficacy when compared to placebo, as indicated by the primary end point (ACR20 response at week 12), achieved in 39.2% (3 mg; P < 0.05), 59.2% (5 mg; P < 0.0001), 70.5% (10 mg; P < 0.0001), and 71.9% (15 mg; P < 0.0001) in the tofacitinib group and 35.9% of patients in the adalimumab group (P = 0.105), compared with 22.0% of patients receiving placebo. Improvements were sustained at week 24, according to the ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates as well as classifications of remission according to the 3-variable Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) using C-reactive protein and the 4-variable DAS28 using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in patients across all tofacitinib treatment arms (n = 272) were urinary tract infection (7.7%), diarrhea (4.8%), headache (4.8%), and bronchitis (4.8%). CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib monotherapy at > 3 mg twice a day was efficacious in the treatment of patients with active RA over 24 weeks and demonstrated a manageable safety profile.',\n",
              "  'Differential molecular response of the transcripts B2A2 and B3A2 to imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) originates from the hematopoietic stem cell and is characterized by the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), which results in the BCR-ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22q-, also known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This chimeric gene codes for a cytoplasmic protein with constitutive tyrosine-kinase activity, responsible for cellular transformation and leukemogenesis in CML. The aim of this observational cohort study was to discriminate and quantify BCR-ABL transcripts in the peripheral blood of patients with CML who were treated with imatinib mesylate (Glivec, Novartis). Twenty-two patients were followed for six months during treatment. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction was performed before treatment and after 3 and 6 months from treatment initiation. As compared with the third month, there was a significant decrease in BCR-ABL expression in the sixth month of treatment (P = 0.0002). At the sixth month, there was a significant difference in the levels of the two major transcripts of BCR-ABL, B2A2 and B3A2 (P = 0.0347), indicating that B2A2 may be more sensitive to imatinib. The results of our study indicate that imatinib is able to modify the natural history of CML, and raise the hypothesis that patients who express the B2A2 transcript may have a better prognosis.',\n",

Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), may be the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the world. Here I will review historical, clinical, neuropathological, genetic, and pathogenic features of MJD, and finish with a brief discussion of present, and possible future, treatment for this currently incurable disorder. Like many other dominantly inherited ataxias, MJD/SCA3 shows remarkable clinical heterogeneity, reflecting the underlying genetic defect: an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat that varies in size among affected persons. This pathogenic repeat in MJD/SCA3 encodes an expanded tract of the amino acid glutamine in the disease protein, which is known as ataxin-3. MJD/SCA3 is one of nine identified polyglutamine neurodegenerative diseases which share features of pathogenesis centered on protein misfolding and accumulation. The specific properties of MJD/SCA3 and its disease protein are discussed in light of what is known about the entire class of polyglutamine diseases.',\n",
              "  \"Salivary adiponectin levels are associated with training intensity but not with bone mass or reproductive function in elite Rhythmic Gymnasts. Elite Rhythmic Gymnasts (RGs) constitute a unique metabolic model and they are prone to developing Anorexia Athletica. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of training intensity on salivary adiponectin levels and assess a possible role of salivary adiponectin levels as a predictive factor of reproductive dysfunction and bone mass acquisition in elite RGs. The study included 80 elite female RGs participating in the World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championship tournament held in Montpellier, France on September 2011. Anthropometric values were assessed, training data and menstrual pattern were recorded, bone mass was measured with Broadband ultrasound attenuation (dB/Mhz) and baseline salivary adiponectin levels were determined. The athletes were classified as intensely and very intensely trained, considering the mean training intensity (40.84h/week). Moreover, considering their reproductive status, they were divided into RG's with normal menstruation, primary amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea. All comparisons were adjusted to age, BMI and body fat percentage differences. Very intensely trained RGs showed higher salivary adiponectin levels (p=0.05). Moreover, salivary adiponectin levels showed significant correlation with training intensity (r=0.409, p=0.003). On the other hand, no association of salivary adiponectin levels was documented with either reproductive function or bone mass acquisition. The results of the present study suggest that, in elite RGs, salivary adiponectin levels are associated with the intensity of training, possibly reflecting the deterioration of energy balance rather than the training stress. On the other hand, a predictive role of salivary adiponectin levels in reproductive dysfunction or bone mass acquisition could not be supported.\",\n",
              "  'Suitability of [18F]altanserin and PET to determine 5-HT2A receptor availability in the rat brain: in vivo and in vitro validation of invasive and non-invasive kinetic models. PURPOSE: While the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin is well established in humans, the present study evaluated its suitability for quantifying cerebral 5-HT2ARs with positron emission tomography (PET) in albino rats. PROCEDURES: Ten Sprague Dawley rats underwent 180 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on the basis of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo 5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated by in vitro autoradiographic saturation experiments in the same animals. RESULT: Overall brain uptake of [18F]altanserin was reliably quantified by invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as reference region shown by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no lipophilic metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound. PET data correlated very well with in vitro autoradiographic data of the same animals. CONCLUSION: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of 5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Models based on both blood input and reference tissue describe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer uptake might, however, cause restrictions in experimental usage.',\n",

PURPOSE: To examine the early impact of the Paediatric Regulation, which entered into force in Europe on 27 January 2007, on the development of pharmaceutical drugs in the therapeutic field of pain submitted to the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) and to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). METHODS: Paediatric Investigations Plans (PIPs) submitted with a Decision (outcome) reached between September 2007 and March 2010 were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 17 Paediatric Investigation Plans submitted, 14 have resulted in an EMA Decision, 3 were withdrawn by the applicants, 8 were granted a full waiver from development, and 1 resulted in a negative opinion. Decisions as issued included 15 clinical trials, with at least 1,282 children to be recruited into studies across five different products. Neonates were included in four of the products. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of submissions indicates a lack of new drugs being developed for the management of pain. Ethical concerns that too many vulnerable children will be recruited into clinical trials must be balanced against limiting the number of off-label prescribing and obtaining age-appropriate information on paediatric use. Now is an opportune time for clinicians, academics, learned societies and industry to collaborate for the benefit of children in pain.',\n",
              "  'Daratumumab, a novel therapeutic human CD38 monoclonal antibody, induces killing of multiple myeloma and other hematological tumors. CD38, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein highly expressed in hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma (MM), represents a promising target for mAb-based immunotherapy. In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb against a unique CD38 epitope. Daratumumab induced potent Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in CD38-expressing lymphoma- and MM-derived cell lines as well as in patient MM cells, both with autologous and allogeneic effector cells. Daratumumab stood out from other CD38 mAbs in its strong ability to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity in patient MM cells. Importantly, daratumumab-induced Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity were not affected by the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, indicating that daratumumab can effectively kill MM tumor cells in a tumor-preserving bone marrow microenvironment. In vivo, daratumumab was highly active and interrupted xenograft tumor growth at low dosing. Collectively, our results show the versatility of daratumumab to effectively kill CD38-expressing tumor cells, including patient MM cells, via diverse cytotoxic mechanisms. These findings support clinical development of daratumumab for the treatment of CD38-positive MM tumors.',\n",
              "  'Decreased cellular uptake and metabolism in Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) due to a novel mutation in the MCT8 thyroid hormone transporter. We report a novel 1 bp deletion (c.1834delC) in the MCT8 gene in a large Brazilian family with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X linked condition characterised by severe mental retardation and neurological dysfunction. The c.1834delC segregates with the disease in this family and it was not present in 100 control chromosomes, further confirming its pathogenicity. This mutation causes a frameshift and the inclusion of 64 additional amino acids in the C-terminal region of the protein. Pathogenic mutations in the MCT8 gene, which encodes a thyroid hormone transporter, results in elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels, which were confirmed in four affected males of this family, while normal levels were found among obligate carriers. Through in vitro functional assays, we showed that this mutation decreases cellular T3 uptake and intracellular T3 metabolism. Therefore, the severe neurological defects present in the patients are due not only to deficiency of intracellular T3, but also to altered metabolism of T3 in central neurones. In addition, the severe muscle hypoplasia observed in most AHDS patients may be a consequence of high serum T3 levels.',\n",

UNLABELLED: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrythmogenic disease characterized by exercise--or stress--induced ventricular tachyarrythmias, syncope, or sudden death, usually in the pediatric age group. Familial occurrence has been noted in about 30% of cases. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or recessive, usually with high penetrance. The causative genes have been mapped to chromosome 1. Mutations of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (RyR2) have been identified in autosomal dominant pedigrees, while calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) mutations are seen in recessive cases. CONCLUSION: Due to its potential lethal outcome, exclusion or confirmation of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in children with physical and emotional syncope is mandatory. We report a case of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in a three-year-old child only diagnosed by genetic mapping.',\n",
              "  'p73 plays a role in erythroid differentiation through GATA1 induction. The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. Although TAp73alpha and -beta proteins are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation, DeltaNp73 acts in many cell types as a dominant-negative repressor of p53 and TAp73. It has been proposed that p73 is involved in myeloid differentiation, and its altered expression is involved in leukemic degeneration. However, there is little evidence as to which p73 variants (TA or DeltaN) are expressed during differentiation and whether specific p73 isoforms have the capacity to induce, or hinder, this differentiation in leukemia cells. In this study we identify GATA1 as a direct transcriptional target of TAp73alpha. Furthermore, TAp73alpha induces GATA1 activity, and it is required for erythroid differentiation. Additionally, we describe a functional cooperation between TAp73 and DeltaNp73 in the context of erythroid differentiation in human myeloid cells, K562 and UT-7. Moreover, the impaired expression of GATA1 and other erythroid genes in the liver of p73KO embryos, together with the moderated anemia observed in p73KO young mice, suggests a physiological role for TP73 in erythropoiesis.',\n",

Insulin plays a very important role in maintaining homeostasis of the whole organism. It regulates glucose metabolism, glycogen synthesis, lipid and protein metabolism. Insulin receptors are present in virtually all cells, which is reflected by the diversity of regulatory processes in which this hormone is involved. Any dysfunction of insulin signalling pathway as a result of insulin receptor gene mutations is linked with various forms of insulin resistance, including insulin resistance type A, Donohue or Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, which differ in the level of severity. Molecular analysis of insulin receptor gene may lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying various types of insulin resistance and help to develop a more efficient treatment. They may also be used as a powerful tool in prenatal diagnostics as well as in pregnancy planning.',\n",
              "  \"Adjusting for background mutation frequency biases improves the identification of cancer driver genes. A common goal of tumor sequencing projects is finding genes whose mutations are selected for during tumor development. This is accomplished by choosing genes that have more non-synonymous mutations than expected from an estimated background mutation frequency. While this background frequency is unknown, it can be estimated using both the observed synonymous mutation frequency and the non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratio. The synonymous mutation frequency can be determined across all genes or in a gene-specific manner. This choice introduces an interesting trade-off. A gene-specific frequency adjusts for an underlying mutation bias, but is difficult to estimate given missing synonymous mutation counts. Using a genome-wide synonymous frequency is more robust, but is less suited for adjusting biases. Studying four evaluation criteria for identifying genes with high non-synonymous mutation burden (reflecting preferential selection of expressed genes, genes with mutations in conserved bases, genes with many protein interactions, and genes that show loss of heterozygosity), we find that the gene-specific synonymous frequency is superior in the gene expression and protein interaction tests. In conclusion, the use of the gene-specific synonymous mutation frequency is well suited for assessing a gene's non-synonymous mutation burden.\",\n",

DATA SOURCES: Summary statements were obtained from each pharmaceutical company regarding their agent. STUDY SELECTION: Each agent is undergoing or has completed phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. RESULTS: Berinert P, a purified, virus-inactivated, human plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate, is being investigated in 2 international, multicenter, prospective trials. Experience with this agent in Europe and Canada indicates it is effective and safe. Cinryze is a nanofiltered C1-INH replacement therapy demonstrated to be effective and safe in acute and prophylactic arms of a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Rhucin, a recombinant human C1-INH replacement therapy from transgenic rabbits, has been shown to be effective and safe in phase 2 and phase 2/3 studies, with an additional phase 3 study ongoing. DX-88 or ecallantide, a potent and specific inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, achieved all primary and secondary efficacy end points in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study, with a second phase 3 study ongoing. Icatibant, a potent and specific peptidomimetic bradykinin 2 receptor antagonist, was studied in 2 phase 3 trials: FAST 1 (For Angioedema Subcutaneous Treatment) did not achieve statistical significance for the primary end point but did so for secondary end points, whereas FAST 2 achieved statistical significance for primary and secondary end points.

              "  'Regulation of NF-κB by ubiquitination and degradation of the IκBs. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway is a busy ground for the action of the ubiquitin-proteasome system; many of the signaling steps are coordinated by protein ubiquitination. The end point of this pathway is to induce transcription, and to this end, there is a need to overcome a major obstacle, a set of inhibitors (IκBs) that bind NF-κB and prohibit either the nuclear entry or the DNA binding of the transcription factor. Two major signaling steps are required for the elimination of the inhibitors: activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) and degradation of the phosphorylated inhibitors. IKK activation and IκB degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(β-TrCP) . The F-box component of this E3, β-TrCP, recognizes the IκB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples IκB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(β-TrCP) -mediated IκB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor IκBα within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of β-TrCP results in accumulation of all the IκBs and complete NF-κB inhibition. As many details of IκB-β-TrCP interaction have been worked out, the development of β-TrCP inhibitors might be a feasible therapeutic approach for NF-κB-associated human disease. However, we may still need to advance our understanding of the mechanism of IκB degradation as well as of the diverse functions of β-TrCP in vivo.',\n",

              "  'Focal cortical dysplasia in meningioangiomatosis. Meningioangiomatosis is a rare, benign, developmental, or hamartomatous lesion which may involve the leptomeninges and underlying brain parenchyma. Histologically, meningioangiomatosis is marked by a proliferation of blood vessels in the parenchyma, rimmed by collars of spindled meningothelial cells. There are anecdotal reports of an association of meningioangiomatosis with focal cortical dysplasia. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, histopathologic, and treatment outcomes of 16 patients with a diagnosis of meningioangiomatosis, specifically investigating these cases for evidence of adjacent focal cortical dysplasia. Patients ranged in age from 1 to 34 years (median 18), 12 of whom had medically-intractable epilepsy as their presenting symptom. No patients in this study had a confirmed diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type II. Four patients (25%) were found to have fibrous meningiomas associated with the meningioangiomatosis. Ten of the 12 patients (83%) who had adequate tissue excised adjacent to the meningioangiomatosis demonstrated evidence of focal cortical dysplasia, with 6 of those (60%) classified as Palmini type IA, and 4 patients (40%) classified as Palmini type IIA. Seven of the patients (44%) had no post-operative seizures, and were off anti-epileptic drugs, while 2 patients relapsed, and required pharmacologic treatment for seizure control. This study therefore presents evidence to support inclusion of meningioangiomatosis as a focal cortical dysplasia-associated entity, as suggested by the ILAE classification (type IIIc). As focal cortical dysplasia is a developmental malformation, its association with meningioangiomatosis supports a developmental etiology of sporadic meningioangiomatosis.',\n",

The lysosome plays a key role in cellular homeostasis by controlling both cellular clearance and energy production to respond to environmental cues. However, the mechanisms mediating lysosomal adaptation are largely unknown. Here, we show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with master growth regulator mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. When nutrients are present, phosphorylation of TFEB by mTORC1 inhibits TFEB activity. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1, as well as starvation and lysosomal disruption, activates TFEB by promoting its nuclear translocation. In addition, the transcriptional response of lysosomal and autophagic genes to either lysosomal dysfunction or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 is suppressed in TFEB-/- cells. Interestingly, the Rag GTPase complex, which senses lysosomal amino acids and activates mTORC1, is both necessary and sufficient to regulate starvation- and stress-induced nuclear translocation of TFEB. These data indicate that the lysosome senses its content and regulates its own biogenesis by a lysosome-to-nucleus signalling mechanism that involves TFEB and mTOR.',\n",

              "  \"Reactivation of an inactive human X chromosome introduced into mouse embryonal carcinoma cells by microcell fusion with persistent expression of XIST. An inactive human X chromosome was introduced by microcell fusion into two mouse embryonal carcinoma cell lines, PSA1-TG8 and OTF9-63, each of which has a single X chromosome. The donor cell line was a mouse-human somatic cell hybrid, CF150, retaining one or more inactive human X chromosome(s) per cell as its only human element. Twenty hybrid clones isolated retained EC morphology and contained the intact human X chromosome(s) or its truncated derivative(s). Replication banding analysis showed that the introduced human X chromosome(s) or its derivative(s) replicated synchronously with other mouse chromosomes, suggesting reactivation of the human X chromosomal elements after transfer. Reversal of inactivation was further confirmed by the expression of five human X-linked genes repressed in CF150, although the XIST (X inactive specific transcript) gene continued to be active. The level of XIST expression in our hybrid cells was almost identical to that of parental CF150 cells. Methylation status of 5' end of the active XIST gene varied considerably from almost full methylation to unmethylation in these hybrids. Thus, mouse EC cells used in this study were capable of altering methylation status of the human XIST gene in a manner lacking consistency and unable to repress its transcription. Furthermore, we failed to obtain any positive evidence for the occurrence of X chromosome inactivation in differentiating monochromosome EC hybrids. Taken together, these findings suggest that the human X chromosome inactivation center including the XIST gene is unable to function effectively in mouse cells.\",\n",
              "  'A Pilot Study of the Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat for Myelofibrosis. BACKGROUND: Current drugs for myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis, including Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, do not induce complete or partial remissions. Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. METHODS: We sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic activity and safety of imetelstat in patients with high-risk or intermediate-2-risk myelofibrosis. Imetelstat was administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (starting dose, 9.4 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 1 to 3 weeks. The primary end point was the overall response rate, and the secondary end points were adverse events, spleen response, and independence from red-cell transfusions. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (median age, 67 years) met the eligibility criteria; 48% had received prior JAK inhibitor therapy. A complete or partial remission occurred in 7 patients (21%), with a median duration of response of 18 months (range, 13 to 20+) for complete responses and 10 months (range, 7 to 10+) for partial responses. Bone marrow fibrosis was reversed in all 4 patients who had a complete response, and a molecular response occurred in 3 of the 4 patients. Response rates were 27% among patients with a JAK2 mutation versus 0% among those without a JAK2 mutation (P=0.30) and 32% among patients without an ASXL1 mutation versus 0% among those with an ASXL1 mutation (P=0.07). The rate of complete response was 38% among patients with a mutation in SF3B1 or U2AF1 versus 4% among patients without a mutation in these genes (P=0.04). Responses did not correlate with baseline telomere length. Treatment-related adverse events included grade 4 thrombocytopenia (in 18% of patients), grade 4 neutropenia (in 12%), grade 3 anemia (in 30%), and grade 1 or 2 elevation in levels of total bilirubin (in 12%), alkaline phosphatase (in 21%), and aspartate aminotransferase (in 27%). CONCLUSIONS: Imetelstat was found to be active in patients with myelofibrosis but also had the potential to cause clinically significant myelosuppression.

              "  'Contributions of CTCF and DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B to Epstein-Barr virus restricted latency. Establishment of persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection requires transition from a program of full viral latency gene expression (latency III) to one that is highly restricted (latency I and 0) within memory B lymphocytes. It is well established that DNA methylation plays a critical role in EBV gene silencing, and recently the chromatin boundary protein CTCF has been implicated as a pivotal regulator of latency via its binding to several loci within the EBV genome. One notable site is upstream of the common EBNA gene promoter Cp, at which CTCF may act as an enhancer-blocking factor to initiate and maintain silencing of EBNA gene transcription. It was previously suggested that increased expression of CTCF may underlie its potential to promote restricted latency, and here we also noted elevated levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3B associated with latency I. Within B-cell lines that maintain latency I, however, stable knockdown of CTCF, DNMT1, or DNMT3B or of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in combination did not result in activation of latency III protein expression or EBNA gene transcription, nor did knockdown of DNMTs significantly alter CpG methylation within Cp. Thus, differential expression of CTCF and DNMT1 and -3B is not critical for maintenance of restricted latency. Finally, mutant EBV lacking the Cp CTCF binding site exhibited sustained Cp activity relative to wild-type EBV in a recently developed B-cell superinfection model but ultimately was able to transition to latency I, suggesting that CTCF contributes to but is not necessarily essential for the establishment of restricted latency.',\n",
              "  'Heme-dependent up-regulation of the alpha-globin gene expression by transcriptional repressor Bach1 in erythroid cells. The transcriptional factor Bach1 forms a heterodimer with small Maf family, and functions as a repressor of the Maf recognition element (MARE) in vivo. To investigate the involvement of Bach1 in the heme-dependent regulation of the expression of the alpha-globin gene, human erythroleukemia K562 cells were cultured with succinylacetone (SA), a heme biosynthetic inhibitor, and the level of alpha-globin mRNA was examined. A decrease of alpha-globin mRNA was observed in SA-treated cells, which was restored by the addition of hemin. The heme-dependent expression of alpha-globin occurred at the transcriptional level since the expression of human alpha-globin gene promoter-reporter gene containing hypersensitive site-40 (HS-40) was decreased when K562 cells were cultured with SA. Hemin treatment restored the decrease of the promoter activity by SA. The regulation of the HS-40 activity by heme was dependent on the NF-E2/AP-1 (NA) site, which is similar to MARE. The NA site-binding activity of Bach1 in K562 increased upon SA-treatment, and the increase was diminished by the addition of hemin. The transient expression of Bach1 and mutated Bach1 lacking CP motifs suppressed the HS-40 activity, and cancellation of the repressor activity by hemin was observed when wild-type Bach1 was expressed. The expression of NF-E2 strengthened the restoration of the Bach1-effect by hemin. Interestingly, nuclear localization of Bach1 increased when cells were treated with SA, while hemin induced the nuclear export of Bach1. These results indicated that heme plays an important role in the induction of alpha-globin gene expression through disrupting the interaction of Bach1 and the NA site in HS-40 enhancer in erythroid cells.',\n",

McLeod syndrome, characterized by acanthocytosis and the absence of a red-blood-cell Kell antigen (Kx), is a multisystem disorder involving a late-onset myopathy, splenomegaly, and neurological defects. The locus for this syndrome has been mapped, by deletion analysis, to a region between the loci for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). In this study, we describe a new marker, 3BH/R 0.3 (DXS 709), isolated by cloning the deletion breakpoint of a DMD patient. A long-range restriction map of Xp21, encompassing the gene loci for McLeod and CGD, was constructed, and multiple CpG islands were found clustered in a 700-kb region. Using the new marker, we have limited the McLeod syndrome critical region to 150-380-kb. Within this interval, two CpG-rich islands which may represent candidate sites for the McLeod gene were identified.',\n",
              "  \"Phase 3 Studies Comparing Brodalumab with Ustekinumab in Psoriasis. BACKGROUND: Early clinical studies suggested that the anti-interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody brodalumab has efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: In two phase 3 studies (AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3), patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were randomly assigned to receive brodalumab (210 mg or 140 mg every 2 weeks), ustekinumab (45 mg for patients with a body weight < 100 kg and 90 mg for patients >100 kg), or placebo. At week 12, patients receiving brodalumab were randomly assigned again to receive a brodalumab maintenance dose of 210 mg every 2 weeks or 140 mg every 2 weeks, every 4 weeks, or every 8 weeks; patients receiving ustekinumab continued to receive ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and patients receiving placebo received 210 mg of brodalumab every 2 weeks. The primary aims were to evaluate the superiority of brodalumab over placebo at week 12 with respect to at least a 75% reduction in the psoriasis area-and-severity index score (PASI 75) and a static physician's global assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin), as well as the superiority of brodalumab over ustekinumab at week 12 with respect to a 100% reduction in PASI score (PASI 100). RESULTS: At week 12, the PASI 75 response rates were higher with brodalumab at the 210-mg and 140-mg doses than with placebo (86% and 67%, respectively, vs. 8% [AMAGINE-2] and 85% and 69%, respectively, vs. 6% [AMAGINE-3]; P<0.001); the rates of sPGA scores of 0 or 1 were also higher with brodalumab (P<0.001). The week 12 PASI 100 response rates were significantly higher with 210 mg of brodalumab than with ustekinumab (44% vs. 22% [AMAGINE-2] and 37% vs. 19% [AMAGINE-3], P<0.001). The PASI 100 response rates with 140 mg of brodalumab were 26% in AMAGINE-2 (P=0.08 for the comparison with ustekinumab) and 27% in AMAGINE-3 (P=0.007). Rates of neutropenia were higher with brodalumab and with ustekinumab than with placebo. Mild or moderate candida infections were more frequent with brodalumab than with ustekinumab or placebo. Through week 52, the rates of serious infectious episodes were 1.0 (AMAGINE-2) and 1.3 (AMAGINE-3) per 100 patient-years of exposure to brodalumab. CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab treatment resulted in significant clinical improvements in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

              "  \"The activation of the decapping enzyme DCP2 by DCP1 occurs on the EDC4 scaffold and involves a conserved loop in DCP1. The removal of the 5'-cap structure by the decapping enzyme DCP2 and its coactivator DCP1 shuts down translation and exposes the mRNA to 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic degradation by XRN1. Although yeast DCP1 and DCP2 directly interact, an additional factor, EDC4, promotes DCP1-DCP2 association in metazoan. Here, we elucidate how the human proteins interact to assemble an active decapping complex and how decapped mRNAs are handed over to XRN1. We show that EDC4 serves as a scaffold for complex assembly, providing binding sites for DCP1, DCP2 and XRN1. DCP2 and XRN1 bind simultaneously to the EDC4 C-terminal domain through short linear motifs (SLiMs). Additionally, DCP1 and DCP2 form direct but weak interactions that are facilitated by EDC4. Mutational and functional studies indicate that the docking of DCP1 and DCP2 on the EDC4 scaffold is a critical step for mRNA decapping in vivo. They also revealed a crucial role for a conserved asparagine-arginine containing loop (the NR-loop) in the DCP1 EVH1 domain in DCP2 activation. Our data indicate that DCP2 activation by DCP1 occurs preferentially on the EDC4 scaffold, which may serve to couple DCP2 activation by DCP1 with 5'-to-3' mRNA degradation by XRN1 in human cells.\",\n",
              "  'Emerging anticoagulants. Warfarin, heparin and their derivatives have been the traditional anticoagulants used for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism. While the modern clinician is familiar with the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these agents, their adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development of newer anticoagulants with improved safety, ease of administration, more predictable pharmacodynamics and comparable efficacy. Research into haemostasis and the coagulation cascade has made the development of these newer anticoagulants possible. These drugs include the factor Xa inhibitors and IIa (thrombin) inhibitors. Direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors are being developed with a relative rapid onset of action and stable pharmacokinetic profiles negating the need for close monitoring; this potentially makes them a more attractive option than heparin or warfarin. Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban. Examples of indirect factor Xa inhibitors include fondaparinux, idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux. Direct thrombin inhibitors (factor IIa inhibitors) were developed with the limitations of standard heparin and warfarin in mind. Examples include recombinant hirudin (lepirudin), bivalirudin, ximelagatran, argatroban, and dabigatran etexilate. This review will discuss emerging novel anticoagulants and their use for the prophylaxis and management of venous thromboembolism, for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and for coronary artery disease.',\n",
              "  'Antitumor efficacy of the anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibody siltuximab in mouse xenograft models of lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) can activate downstream signaling pathways in lung cancer cells, such as the STAT3 pathway, and is reported to be produced by tumor cells with activating EGFR mutations. We examined IL-6/STAT3 in lung cancer tumor tissues and the effects of siltuximab, a neutralizing antibody to human IL-6, in mouse models of lung cancer. METHODS: IL-6 and STAT3 activation levels were compared with tumor histology and presence of KRAS mutations in snap-frozen, non-small-cell lung cancer tumors. The effects of siltuximab alone or in combination with erlotinib were examined in mouse xenograft models constructed using three cell line xenograft models and one primary explant mouse model. We examined the influence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on tumor growth and siltuximab effects. RESULTS: IL-6 levels were higher in tumors of squamous cell versus adenocarcinoma histology and were not associated with presence of KRAS mutations. Tyrosine phosphorylation status of STAT3 did not correlate with tumor IL-6 levels. Serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was correlated with KRAS mutation status. Both tumor and stromal cells contributed to total IL-6 within tumors. Siltuximab had minimal effect as a single agent in xenografts with tumor cells alone; however, in models coadministered with CAFs, siltuximab had more potent effects on tumor inhibition. We observed no effects of combined erlotinib and siltuximab. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 is elevated in subsets of human NSCLCs, especially with squamous cell histology. Tumors supported by stromal production of IL-6 seem to be the most vulnerable to tumor growth inhibition by siltuximab.',\n",
              "  \"Identification and characterization of a selenoprotein family containing a diselenide bond in a redox motif. Selenocysteine (Sec, U) insertion into proteins is directed by translational recoding of specific UGA codons located upstream of a stem-loop structure known as Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element. Selenoproteins with known functions are oxidoreductases containing a single redox-active Sec in their active sites. In this work, we identified a family of selenoproteins, designated SelL, containing two Sec separated by two other residues to form a UxxU motif. SelL proteins show an unusual occurrence, being present in diverse aquatic organisms, including fish, invertebrates, and marine bacteria. Both eukaryotic and bacterial SelL genes use single SECIS elements for insertion of two Sec. In eukaryotes, the SECIS is located in the 3' UTR, whereas the bacterial SelL SECIS is within a coding region and positioned at a distance that supports the insertion of either of the two Sec or both of these residues. SelL proteins possess a thioredoxin-like fold wherein the UxxU motif corresponds to the catalytic CxxC motif in thioredoxins, suggesting a redox function of SelL proteins. Distantly related SelL-like proteins were also identified in a variety of organisms that had either one or both Sec replaced with Cys. Danio rerio SelL, transiently expressed in mammalian cells, incorporated two Sec and localized to the cytosol. In these cells, it occurred in an oxidized form and was not reducible by DTT. In a bacterial expression system, we directly demonstrated the formation of a diselenide bond between the two Sec, establishing it as the first diselenide bond found in a natural protein.\",\n",
              "  'Ataxin-3 protein modification as a treatment strategy for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3: removal of the CAG containing exon. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. The expanded glutamine stretch in the protein is the result of a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the penultimate exon of the ATXN3 gene. Several gene silencing approaches to reduce mutant ataxin-3 toxicity in this disease aim to lower ataxin-3 protein levels, but since this protein is involved in deubiquitination and proteasomal protein degradation, its long-term silencing might not be desirable. Here, we propose a novel protein modification approach to reduce mutant ataxin-3 toxicity by removing the toxic polyglutamine repeat from the ataxin-3 protein through antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping while maintaining important wild type functions of the protein. In vitro studies showed that exon skipping did not negatively impact the ubiquitin binding capacity of ataxin-3. Our in vivo studies showed no toxic properties of the novel truncated ataxin-3 protein. These results suggest that exon skipping may be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce polyglutamine-induced toxicity in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.',\n",

Selected family histories and recorded events during pregnancy are also reported. The sex ratio is 1:1 (60 males, 59 females). All 94 pedigrees except one (an affected father and daughter) represent sporadic instances. Combining our cases with those available in the literature, only nine familial instances are known to date. The familial cases, the equal number of affected males and females, and the increased paternal age in sporadic cases strongly suggest autosomal dominant inheritance. The rarity of familial instances can be explained by reduced genetic fitness of affected individuals because severe malformations and the presence of mental deficiency, found in many cases, diminish desirability as mates. The variability of the syndrome has been defined mainly on the basis of sporadic cases. High resolution banding was normal in five recently studied cases.',\n",

              "  'JAK inhibitor tofacitinib for treating rheumatoid arthritis: from basic to clinical. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a representative autoimmune disease characterized by chronic and destructive inflammatory synovitis. The multiple cytokines play pivotal roles in RA pathogenesis by inducing intracellular signaling, and members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family are essential for such signal transduction. An orally available JAK3 inhibitor, tofacitinib, has been applied for RA, with satisfactory effects and acceptable safety in multiple clinical examinations. From phase 2 dose-finding studies, tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice a day appear suitable for further evaluation. Subsequently, multiple phase 3 studies were carried out, and tofacitinib with or without methotrexate (MTX) is efficacious and has a manageable safety profile in active RA patients who are MTX naïve or show inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX-IR), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)-IR, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor-IR. The common adverse events were infections, such as nasopharyngitis; increases in cholesterol, transaminase, and creatinine; and decreases in neutrophil counts. Although the mode of action of tofacitinib remains unclear, we clarified that the inhibitory effects of tofacitinib could be mediated through suppression of interleukin (IL)-17 and interferon (IFN)-γ production and proliferation of CD4(+) T cells in the inflamed synovium. Taken together, an orally available kinase inhibitor tofacitinib targeting JAK-mediated signals would be expected to be a new option for RA treatment.',\n",
              "  'Williams Syndrome. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Williams syndrome (WS) is characterized by cardiovascular disease (elastin arteriopathy, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, supravalvar aortic stenosis, hypertension), distinctive facies, connective tissue abnormalities, intellectual disability (usually mild), a specific cognitive profile, unique personality characteristics, growth abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypothyroidism, and early puberty). Feeding difficulties often lead to poor weight gain in infancy. Hypotonia and hyperextensible joints can result in delayed attainment of motor milestones. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Clinical diagnostic criteria are available for Williams syndrome; however, the diagnosis requires detection of a recurrent 7q11.23 contiguous gene deletion of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR) that encompasses the elastin gene (ELN). This contiguous gene deletion can be detected using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or deletion/duplication testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Early intervention programs, special education programs, and vocational training address developmental disabilities; programs include speech/language, physical, occupational, feeding, and sensory integration therapies. Psychological and psychiatric evaluation and treatment provide individualized behavioral counseling and medications, especially for attention deficit disorder and anxiety. Surgery may be required for supravalvar aortic or pulmonary artery stenosis, mitral valve insufficiency, and/or renal artery stenosis. Treatment of hypercalcemia may include diet modification, oral corticosteroids, and/or intravenous pamidronate. Refer to a nephrologist for management of nephrocalcinosis, persistent hypercalcemia, and/or hypercalciuria. Treatment of hypertension, hyperopia, and recurrent otitis media does not differ from that in the general population. Orthodontic referral should be considered for malocclusion. Infants with feeding problems may benefit from feeding therapy. Constipation should be aggressively managed at all ages. Early puberty may be treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. Prevention of secondary complications: Range of motion exercises to prevent or ameliorate joint contractures; anesthesia consultation and electrocardiogram prior to sedation and surgical procedures. Surveillance: Annual medical evaluation, vision screening, hearing evaluation, measurement of blood pressure in both arms, calcium/creatinine ratio in spot urine, and urinalysis. Children younger than age two years should have serum calcium studies every four to six months. Thyroid function should be checked yearly until age three years and every two years thereafter. Additional periodic evaluations for all individuals include: measurement of serum concentration of calcium every two years; cardiology evaluation for elastin arteriopathy at least annually for the first five years and every two to three years thereafter for life; and renal and bladder ultrasound examination every ten years. Additional periodic evaluations during adulthood include: oral glucose tolerance; cardiac evaluation for mitral valve prolapse, aortic insufficiency, hypertension, long QT interval, and arterial stenoses; and ophthalmologic evaluation for cataracts. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Multivitamins for children because all pediatric multivitamin preparations contain vitamin D. GENETIC COUNSELING: Williams syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. Most cases are de novo occurrences, but occasionally, parent-to-child transmission is observed. Prenatal testing is possible but is rarely used because most cases occur in a single family member only, and no prenatal indicators exist for low-risk pregnancies.',\n",
              "  'Low frequency of germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene in patients with apparently sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes. The distinction between true sporadic MTC and a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and family. The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene. Systematic analysis for germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene was performed in a series of 67 patients with apparently sporadic MTC to determine whether they were true sporadic cases or unsuspected de novo MEN 2 cases. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Sixty-seven unselected patients with sporadic MTC were randomly ascertained from clinic patients from four centres. The diagnosis of MTC was confirmed by histopathology. Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes or from paraffin-embedded tissue and subsequently used for polymerase chain reaction amplification. MEASUREMENTS: Polymerase chain reaction based RET mutation analysis was performed by direct double-stranded cycle sequencing of exons 10, 11, 13 and 16, within which the majority of MEN2 mutations have been shown to occur. RESULTS: In this series, there was one proven case of germline mutation in RET codon 620, which previously has been shown to be responsible for MEN 2, thus indicating heritable disease. No germline mutation in codon 918, typical of MEN 2B, was found. CONCLUSIONS: A figure of 1.5% germline mutations in 67 apparently sporadic MTC is lower than the incidence of familial disease reported in previous series involving clinical and biochemical screening. The presence of a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in a patient with MTC indicates heritable disease. The absence of germline RET exon 10, 11, 13 or 16 mutation appears to rule out MEN 2A to a high probability, although the presence of a familial form of MTC other than classical MEN 2A cannot be excluded conclusively.',\n",

METHODS: The present paper describes, for a pivotal phase III efficacy of the RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccine, the methods of the statistical analysis and the rationale for their selection. The methods used to estimate efficacy of the primary course of vaccination, and of a booster dose, in preventing clinical episodes of uncomplicated and severe malaria, and to determine the duration of protection, are described. The interpretation of various measures of efficacy in terms of the potential public health impact of the vaccine is discussed.

The translocation (9;22) gives rise to the p190(Bcr-Abl) and p210(Bcr-Abl) tyrosine kinase proteins, considered sufficient for leukemic transformation. Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) acute leukemia patients failing to respond to initial induction therapy have a poor prognosis with few effective treatment options. Imatinib is an orally administered, potent inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. We conducted a clinical trial in 56 patients with relapsed or refractory Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 48 patients) or chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis (LyBC; 8 patients). Imatinib was given once daily at 400 mg or 600 mg. Imatinib induced complete hematologic responses (CHRs) and complete marrow responses (marrow-CRs) in 29% of ALL patients (CHR, 19%; marrow-CR, 10%), which were sustained for at least 4 weeks in 6% of patients. Median estimated time to progression and overall survival for ALL patients were 2.2 and 4.9 months, respectively. CHRs were reported for 3 (38%) of the patients with LyBC (one sustained CHR). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related nonhematologic toxicity was reported for 9% of patients; none of the patients discontinued therapy because of nonhematologic adverse reactions. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 54% and 27% of patients, respectively. Imatinib therapy resulted in a clinically relevant hematologic response rate in relapsed or refractory Ph(+) acute lymphoid leukemia patients, but development of resistance and subsequent disease progression were rapid. Further studies are warranted to test the effects of imatinib in combination with other agents and to define the mechanisms of resistance to imatinib.',\n",

Until now, sex determination in equine embryos has been performed by detection of Y-chromosome-specific sequences only. In the present study, expression of a Barr-body-specific marker, the X-inactivated-specific transcript (Xist) gene, whose gene product consists of RNA which coats and thereby inactivates one of the X chromosomes, was investigated in equine embryos produced in vivo. Preattachment embryos at different times after ovulation (Day 8: n = 9; Day 10: n = 12; Day 12: n = 15) were analyzed for Xist RNA expression using quantitative and qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Female and male primary equine dermal cell cultures were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Embryos tested negative for Xist were evaluated for expression of the male-specific eSRY gene by qualitative PCR at the DNA level. From 36 embryos assessed by qualitative RT-PCR, 18 showed positive Xist expression (50%). From 29 embryos tested by quantitative RT-PCR, 16 showed positive Xist expression (55%). All of the Xist-negative equine embryos tested by quantitative PCR were positive for eSRY. We also demonstrated by strand-specific RT-PCR that in the horse, as in humans, the counter transcript Tsix seems to be truncated not reaching Exon 1. In contrast to many other species, neither Xist nor Tsix was expressed in equine male testicular tissue. The results demonstrate that expression of Xist is restricted to female equine embryos. Xist can thus be considered an X-inactivation-specific marker which can be used in concert with Y-specific markers for sex determination.',\n",

Incorporating the use of markers of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition into clinical trials led to the realization that imatinib-resistant kinase domain mutations are the major cause of relapse during imatinib therapy and the subsequent development of new inhibitors to treat CML patients. The development of imatinib validates an emerging paradigm in cancer, in which a tumor is defined by genetic abnormalities and effective therapies are developed that target events critical to the growth and survival of a specific tumor.',\n",

              "  'Delamanid: a review of its use in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Delamanid (Deltyba(®)), a nitroimidazo-oxazole derivative, is a new anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug which exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antitubercular activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is approved in several countries, including Japan and those of the EU, for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen in adults with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed due to resistance or tolerability. In a robust phase\\xa0II trial in adult patients with MDR-TB, oral delamanid 100\\xa0mg twice daily for 2\\xa0months plus an optimized background regimen improved sputum culture conversion rates to a significantly greater extent than placebo. In a 6-month extension study, long-term ( < 8\\xa0months) treatment with delamanid was associated with a higher incidence of favourable outcomes (i.e. cured or completed all treatment) than short-term ( < 2\\xa0months) treatment, with an accompanying reduction inunfavourable outcomes as defined by the WHO (i.e. pre-specified proportion of TB-positive sputum cultures, death or treatment discontinuation for > 2\\xa0months without medical approval). Delamanid was not associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions, including with antiretroviral drugs and those commonly used in treating TB. Delamanid was generally well tolerated in patients with MDR-TB, with gastrointestinal adverse events and insomnia reported most commonly. Although the incidence of QT interval prolongation was higher with delamanid-based therapy, it was not associated with clinical symptoms such as syncope and arrhythmia. In conclusion, delamanid is a useful addition to the treatment options currently available for patients with MDR-TB.',\n",
              "  'Treatment of idiopathic parkinsonism with L-dopa in the absence and presence of decarboxylase inhibitors: effects on plasma levels of L-dopa, dopa decarboxylase, catecholamines and 3-O-methyl-dopa. The effect of levodopa (L-dopa), alone or in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (PDI), on plasma levels of aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase (ALAAD, = dopa decarboxylase), L-dopa, 3-O-methyl-dopa (3-OMD), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine beta-hydroxylase has been studied. In healthy subjects and in patients with parkinsonism plasma ALAAD level fell after administration of L-dopa + benserazide, but returned to previous levels within 90 min. In a cross-sectional study blood was obtained, 2 h after dosing, from 104 patients with idiopathic parkinsonism, divided into four groups: no L-dopa treatment (group 1), L-dopa alone (group 2), L-dopa + benserazide (Madopar) (group 3) and L-dopa + carbidopa (Sinemet) (group 4). Plasma ALAAD, which was normal in groups 1 and 2, was increased 3-fold in groups 3 and 4, indicating that there was induction of ALAAD by the co-administration of PDI. Despite this induction of ALAAD, in groups 3 and 4, with half the daily L-dopa dose compared with group 2, plasma L-dopa and 3-OMD levels were 5 times higher, while plasma DA levels were not different. The DA/L-dopa ratio was decreased 5-fold in group 2 and 16-fold in groups 3 and 4 as compared with group 1. Neither 3-OMD levels nor 3-OMD/L-dopa ratios correlated with the occurrence of on-off fluctuations. In a longitudinal study of three patients started on Madopar treatment the induction of plasma ALAAD was found to occur gradually over 3-4 weeks. Further detailed pharmacokinetic studies in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid are required in order to elucidate whether the ALAAD induction by PDI may be related to the loss of clinical efficacy of combination therapy in some patients and how it is related to end-of-dose deterioration and on-off phenomena.',\n",
              "  'Heterogeneity of genomes: measures and values. Genomic homogeneity is investigated for a broad base of DNA sequences in terms of dinucleotide relative abundance distances (abbreviated delta-distances) and of oligonucleotide compositional extremes. It is shown that delta-distances between different genomic sequences in the same species are low, only about 2 or 3 times the distance found in random DNA, and are generally smaller than the between-species delta-distances. Extremes in short oligonucleotides include underrepresentation of TpA and overrepresentation of GpC in most temperate bacteriophage sequences; underrepresentation of CTAG in most eubacterial genomes; underrepresentation of GATC in most bacteriophage; CpG suppression in vertebrates, in all animal mitochondrial genomes, and in many thermophilic bacterial sequences; and overrepresentation of GpG/CpC in all animal mitochondrial sets and chloroplast genomes. Interpretations center on DNA structures (dinucleotide stacking energies, DNA curvature and superhelicity, nucleosome organization), context-dependent mutational events, methylation effects, and processes of replication and repair.',\n",
              "  'Resolving the daratumumab interference with blood compatibility testing. BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myeloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells. During routine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a positive antibody screen and panreactivity on red blood cell (RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized that the observed panreactivity reflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs, and we investigated methods to prevent this binding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. To remove cell surface CD38, cells were incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) or trypsin. Soluble CD38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA in solution. Routine blood bank serologic methods were used to test samples from DARA-treated patients and normal plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HL60 cells, but not to CD38- controls. DTT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA binding by 92% by denaturing cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DTT is a robust method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patients. Because DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are provided to these patients.',\n",
              "  'Semi-synthesis of cyclosporins. BACKGROUND: Since its isolation in 1970, and discovery of its potent inhibitory activity on T-cell proliferation, cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to play a significant role in diverse fields of biology. Furthermore, chemical modification of CsA has led to analogs with distinct biological activities associated with its protein receptor family, cyclophilins. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review systematically collates the synthetic chemistry performed at each of the eleven amino acids, and provides examples of the utility of such transformations. The various modifications of CsA are traced from early, modest chemistry performed at the unique Bmt residue, through the remarkable use of a polyanion enolate that can be stereoselectively manipulated, and onto application of more recently developed olefin metathesis chemistry to prepare new CsA derivatives with unexpected biological activity. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The myriad biological activities of CsA and its synthetic derivatives have inspired the development of new approaches to modify the CsA ring. In turn, these new CsA derivatives have served as tools in the discovery of new roles for cyclophilins. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This review provides information on the types of cyclosporin derivatives that are available to the many biologists working in this field, and should be of value to the medicinal chemist trying to discover drugs based on CsA. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Proline-directed foldases: Cell signaling catalysts and drug targets.',\n",
              "  \"Site-specific deamidation of glutamine: a new marker of bone collagen deterioration. RATIONALE: Non-enzymatic deamidation accumulates in aging tissues in vivo and has been proposed to be potentially useful as a molecular clock. The process continues post mortem, and here we explore the increase in levels of deamidation in archaeological collagen, as measured during Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) analysis. METHODS: With the high sensitivity of current generation mass spectrometers, ZooMS provides a non-destructive and highly cost-effective method to characterise collagen peptides. Deamidation can be detected by mass spectrometry as a +0.984 Da mass shift; therefore, aside from its original purpose, peptide mass-fingerprinting for bone identification, ZooMS concurrently yields a 'thermal indicator' of the samples. RESULTS: By analysis of conventional ZooMS spectra, we determined the deamidation rate for glutamine residues in 911 bone collagen samples from 50 sites, with ages varying from medieval to Palaeolithic. The degree of deamidation was compared to diagenetic parameters and nearby sequence properties. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of deamidation was found to be influenced more by burial conditions and thermal age than, for example, chronological age, the extent of bioerosion or crystallinity. The method lends itself mostly to screening heterogenic deposits of bone to identify outliers.\",\n",
              "  'Expression of DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalities such as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, developmental abnormality of fin muscle, disorganization of facial musculature and/or degeneration of trunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant localization of myogenic cells marked with α-actin promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside somite boundary, especially in head region. These abnormalities were rescued by coinjection of the short form of DUX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, even at extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FSHD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also propose that DUX4 expression during development is important for the pathogenesis of FSHD.',\n",
              "  \"Watching the watcher: regulation of p53 by mitochondria. p53 has been referred to as the 'guardian of the genome' because of its role in protecting the cell from DNA damage. p53 performs its duties by regulating cell-cycle progression and DNA repair and, in cases of irreparable DNA damage, by executing programmed cell death. Mitochondria are an important target of transcription-dependent and -independent actions of p53 to carry out the apoptotic function. However, increasing evidence suggests that p53 activity is regulated by mitochondria. Cellular insults that alter mitochondrial function can have important consequences on p53 activity. In light of these new findings, the following review focuses on p53/mitochondria connections, in particular how reactive oxygen species generated at mitochondria regulate p53 activity. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which mitochondria regulate p53 may have an impact on our understanding of the development and progression of many diseases, especially cancer.\",\n",
              "  'Clinical experience in the screening and management of a large kindred with familial isolated pituitary adenoma due to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) mutation. CONTEXT: Germline AIP mutations usually cause young-onset acromegaly with low penetrance in a subset of familial isolated pituitary adenoma families. We describe our experience with a large family with R304* AIP mutation and discuss some of the diagnostic dilemmas and management issues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify and screen mutation carriers in the family. PATIENTS: Forty-three family members participated in the study. SETTING: The study was performed in university hospitals. OUTCOME: We conducted genetic and endocrine screening of family members. RESULTS: We identified 18 carriers of the R304* mutation, three family members with an AIP-variant A299V, and two family members who harbored both changes. One of the two index cases presented with gigantism and pituitary apoplexy, the other presented with young-onset acromegaly, and both had surgery and radiotherapy. After genetic and clinical screening of the family, two R304* carriers were diagnosed with acromegaly. They underwent transsphenoidal surgery after a short period of somatostatin analog treatment. One of these two patients is in remission; the other achieved successful pregnancy despite suboptimal control of acromegaly. One of the A299V carrier family members was previously diagnosed with a microprolactinoma; we consider this case to be a phenocopy. Height of the unaffected R304* carrier family members is not different compared to noncarrier relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Families with AIP mutations present particular problems such as the occurrence of large invasive tumors, poor response to medical treatment, difficulties with fertility and management of pregnancy, and the finding of AIP sequence variants of unknown significance. Because disease mostly develops at a younger age and penetrance is low, the timing and duration of the follow-up of carriers without overt disease requires further study. The psychological and financial impact of prolonged clinical screening must be considered. Excellent relationships between the family, endocrinologists, and geneticists are essential, and ideally these families should be managed in centers with specialist expertise.',\n",
              "  'A human polymorphism of protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor-1 is associated with attenuated contractile response of cardiomyocytes to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Aberrant beta-adrenergic signaling and depressed calcium homeostasis, associated with an imbalance of protein kinase A and phosphatase-1 activities, are hallmarks of heart failure. Phosphatase-1 is restrained by its endogenous inhibitor, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1). We assessed 352 normal subjects, along with 959 patients with heart failure and identified a polymorphism in PPI-1 (G147D) exclusively in black subjects. To determine whether the G147D variant could affect cardiac function, we infected adult cardiomyocytes with adenoviruses expressing D147 or wild-type (G147) PPI-1. Under basal conditions, there were no significant differences in fractional shortening or contraction or relaxation rates. However, the enhancement of contractile parameters after isoproterenol stimulation was significantly blunted in D147 compared with G147 and control myocytes. Similar findings were observed in calcium kinetics. The attenuated beta-agonist response was associated with decreased (50%) phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at serine 16, whereas phosphorylation of troponin I and ryanodine receptor was unaltered. These findings suggest that the human G147D PPI-1 can attenuate responses of cardiomyocytes to beta-adrenergic agonists by decreasing PLN phosphorylation and therefore may contribute to deteriorated function in heart failure.',\n",
              "  'FKBP12.6-mediated stabilization of calcium-release channel (ryanodine receptor) as a novel therapeutic strategy against heart failure. BACKGROUND: The development of heart failure is tightly correlated with a decrease in the stoichiometric ratio for FKBP12.6 binding to the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We report that a new drug, the 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, reverses this pathogenic process. JTV519 is known to have a protective effect against Ca2+ overload-induced myocardial injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Heart failure was produced by 4 weeks of rapid right ventricular pacing, with or without JTV519; SR were then isolated from dog left ventricular (LV) muscles. First, in JTV519-treated dogs, no signs of heart failure were observed after 4 weeks of chronic right ventricular pacing, LV systolic and diastolic functions were largely preserved, and LV remodeling was prevented. Second, JTV519 acutely inhibited both the FK506-induced Ca2+ leak from RyR in normal SR and the spontaneous Ca2+ leak in failing SR. Third, there was no abnormal Ca2+ leak in SR vesicles isolated from JTV519-treated hearts. Fourth, in JTV519-treated hearts, both the stoichiometry of FKBP12.6 binding to RyR and the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 were restored toward the values seen in normal SR. Fifth, in JTV519-untreated hearts, RyR was PKA-hyperphosphorylated, whereas it was reversed in JTV519-treated hearts, returning the channel phosphorylation toward the levels seen in normal hearts. CONCLUSIONS: During the development of experimental heart failure, JTV519 prevented the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 from decreasing. This in turn reduced the abnormal Ca2+ leak through the RyR, prevented LV remodeling, and led to less severe heart failure.',\n",
              "  'Anti-interleukin-5 antibody treatment (mepolizumab) in active eosinophilic oesophagitis: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. OBJECTIVE: Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoO) is a clinicopathological condition defined by proton pump inhibitor-refractory oesophageal symptoms combined with oesophageal eosinophilia. The pharmacodynamic effect of mepolizumab (a humanised anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody) in EoO was evaluated. METHODS: Eleven adults with active EoO (>20 peak eosinophil number/high power field (hpf) and dysphagia) were randomised to 750 mg of mepolizumab (n = 5) or placebo (n = 6) and received two intravenous infusions, 1 week apart. Those not in complete remission (<5 peak eosinophil number/hpf) after 8 weeks received two further doses 4 weeks apart, 1500 mg of mepolizumab or placebo. The effect of mepolizumab was assessed clinically, endoscopically, histologically, and via blood and tissue biomarkers. RESULTS: As assessed by immunofluorescence, a marked reduction of mean oesophageal eosinophilia (p = 0.03) was seen in the mepolizumab group (-54%) compared with the placebo group (-5%) 4 weeks after initiation of treatment. No further reduction of eosinophil numbers was observed in response to the two additional infusions in either group. Mepolizumab reduced tenascin C (p = 0.033) and transforming growth factor beta1 (p = 0.05) expression in the oesophageal epithelial layer 13 weeks after initiation of treatment. Clinically, limited improvement of symptoms was seen, although a trend was seen between 4 and 13 weeks after initiation of mepolizumab treatment. Mepolizumab was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Mepolizumab significantly reduced eosinophil numbers in oesophageal tissues in adult patients with active EoO, and changes in the expression of molecules associated with oesophageal remodelling were reversed. Minimal clinical improvement was achieved in a subgroup of patients with EoO. Mepolizumab had an acceptable safety profile, even at the high 1500 mg dose level.

              "  'BRCA1-associated epigenetic regulation of p73 mediates an effector pathway for chemosensitivity in ovarian carcinoma. The majority of tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers exhibit inactivation of p53, a key effector of cell death after DNA damage. Despite the loss of p53, BRCA1-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cisplatin, and patients with BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinomas experience improved outcomes with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with sporadic cases. Although it is known that chemosensitivity in BRCA1-associated cancers is associated with unrepaired DNA damage, the specific effector pathway mediating the cellular response to platinum-induced damage in these tumors is poorly understood. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73, encoding a proapoptotic protein that is linked to chemosensitivity in many settings, is upregulated through a novel epigenetic mechanism in both human and murine models of BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinoma. BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor ZEB1, leading to the abrogation of ZEB1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms (TAp73). Cisplatin chemotherapy induces TAp73 target genes specifically in BRCA1-deficient cells, and knockdown of TAp73 in these cells causes chemoresistance while having little or no effect on BRCA1-expressing tumor cells. In primary ovarian carcinomas, ZEB1 binding site methylation and TAp73 expression correlate with BRCA1 status and with clinical response. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism that supports the contribution of TAp73 as an important mediator of the response to platinum chemotherapy in a subset of ovarian carcinomas. TAp73 might represent a response predictor and potential therapeutic target for enhancing chemosensitivity in this disease.',\n",
              "  'RET proto-oncogene mutations are restricted to codon 618 in Cypriot families with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2. BACKGROUND: RET germline mutations predispose to the development of inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Several variants of the RET proto-oncogene including G691S and S904S have been suggested to act as genetic modifiers at the age of onset ofMEN2. AIM: The aim of this study is to characterize clinically and molecularly 7 Cypriot patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and 1 with MEN2A and also to determine the allelic frequencies of the RET variants G691S and S904S. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven probands from FMTC families and 1 from MEN2A were screened for the presence of RET mutations and the G691S and S904S variants. Additionally, 226 healthy Cypriots, who served as controls were analysed in an attempt to compare the frequencies of G691S and S904S RET variants to those observed in the 8 patients. RESULTS: The clinical diagnosis of the probands was based on clinical presentation and supported with biochemical findings. The germline C618R mutation of exon 10 was identified in all 8 probands and in 15 relatives from 7 different families. No significant difference in the G691S/S904S variants allele frequencies between patients (4/16 or 25%) and controls (124/452 or 27.4%) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Mutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A) unrelated Cypriot patients which may be explained by a founder effect. Additionally, no association of the G691S/S904S variants was linked with the disease.',\n",

Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition is a novel mode of treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin lowered blood glucose, blood pressure, and body weight, with increased risk of urogenital infections in Phase 2 studies. Effects on macrovascular complications of diabetes remain to be determined. CANVAS is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of canagliflozin on the risk of cardiovascular disease and to assess safety and tolerability in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk. The first of 2 planned phases randomized 4,330 individuals to placebo, canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg (1:1:1) with planned follow-up of about 2 years to substantiate potential cardiovascular protection by assessing key biomarkers and to achieve initial safety objectives. By the end of mid-September 2012, a total of 7174 patient-years of follow-up were accrued. Mean baseline age was 62 years, duration of diabetes 13 years; hemoglobin A1c 8.2%, fasting plasma glucose 9.3 mmol/L, and body mass index 32 kg/m(2). Of the participants, 34% are female and 57% had a history of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Participants will be followed up to achieve primary safety and tolerability objectives and to investigate secondary outcomes. The planned second phase will not be undertaken. CANVAS will define the effects of canagliflozin on biomarkers and provide data on cardiovascular safety against established regulatory parameters.',\n",

A critical piece in the translation of preclinical studies to clinical trials is the determination of dosing regimens that allow maximum therapeutic benefit with minimum toxicity. The preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, in a mouse collagen-induced arthritis (mCIA) model was compared with clinical PK/PD data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Preclinical evaluations included target modulation and PK/PD modeling based on continuous subcutaneous infusion or oral once- or twice-daily (BID) dosing paradigms in mice. The human PK/PD profile was obtained from pooled data from four phase 2 studies in patients with RA, and maximal effect models were used to evaluate efficacy after 12 weeks of tofacitinib treatment (1-15 mg BID). In mCIA, the main driver of efficacy was inhibition of cytokine receptor signaling mediated by JAK1 heterodimers, but not JAK2 homodimers, and continuous daily inhibition was not required to maintain efficacy. Projected efficacy could be predicted from total daily exposure irrespective of the oral dosing paradigm, with a total steady-state plasma concentration achieving 50% of the maximal response (Cave50) of ~100 nM. Tofacitinib potency (ED50) in clinical studies was ~3.5 mg BID (90% confidence interval: 2.3, 5.5) or total Cave50 of ~40 nM, derived using Disease Activity Scores from patients with RA. The collective clinical and preclinical data indicated the importance of Cave as a driver of efficacy, rather than maximum or minimum plasma concentration (Cmax or Cmin), where Cave50 values were within ~2-fold of each other.',\n",
              "  'Clinical perspective of afatinib in non-small cell lung cancer. Reversible ATP-competitive inhibitors targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been established as the most effective treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring \"activating\" mutations in exons 19 and 21 of the EGFR gene. However, clinical activity is limited by acquired resistance which on average develops within 10 months of continued treatment. The mechanisms for acquired resistance include selection of the EGFR T790M mutation in approximately 50% of cases, and MET gene amplification, PIK3CA gene mutation, transdifferentiation into small-cell lung cancer and additional rare or unkown mechanisms. Afatinib is a small molecule covalently binding and inhibiting the EGFR, HER2 and HER4 receptor tyrosine kinases. In preclinical studies, afatinib not only inhibited the growth of models with common activating EGFR mutations, but was also active in lung cancer models harboring wild-type EGFR or the EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant. Clinical efficacy of afatinib has been extensively studied in the LUX-Lung study program. These trials showed promising efficacy in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC or enriched for clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib. Here we review the current status of clinical application of afatinib in NSCLC. We also discuss clinical aspects of resistance to afatinib and strategies for its circumvention.',\n",

Double homeobox 4 (DUX4) is a candidate disease gene for facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), one of the most common muscular dystrophies characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration. Despite great strides in understanding precise genetics of FSHD, the molecular pathophysiology of the disease remains unclear. One of the major limitations has been the availability of appropriate molecular tools to study DUX4 protein. In the present study, we report the development of five new monoclonal antibodies targeted against the N- and C-termini of human DUX4, and characterize their reactivity using Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Additionally, we show that expression of the canonical full coding DUX4 induces cell death in human primary muscle cells, whereas the expression of a shorter splice form of DUX4 results in no such toxicity. Immunostaining with these new antibodies reveals a differential effect of two DUX4 isoforms on human muscle cells. These antibodies will provide an excellent tool for investigating the role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis.',\n",
              "  'A comparison of cyclosporine binding by cyclophilin and calmodulin and the identification of a novel 45 KD cyclosporine-binding phosphoprotein in Jurkat cells. Cyclosporine mediates its immunosuppressive effect by preventing the synthesis of lymphokine mRNA during the process of T lymphocyte activation. Although the detailed molecular mechanism by which CsA achieves this effect is unknown, two proteins have been identified as putative intracellular CsA-receptor proteins. One of these, calmodulin, is an important Ca++-binding protein and enzyme cofactor and the other, cyclophilin, is a novel protein that is reported to have protein kinase activity. In this study the CsA-binding capacity of both these proteins has been assessed using CsA-coated ELISA plates and CsA-affinity gel matrices. CsA binding was shown by cyclophilin whereas no CsA-calmodulin binding could be detected under identical conditions. However, it was not possible to demonstrate any cyclophilin-associated protein kinase activity. Jurkat cells were probed for the presence of CsA-binding proteins using the CsA-affinity gel matrix; a 17 KD protein, most probably cyclophilin, was identified as the major CsA-binding protein. In addition, a previously unidentified CsA-binding 45 KD phosphoprotein was precipitated from 32P-labeled Jurkat cells. These results would support cyclophilin as the major, if not only, intracellular receptor protein for CsA. However, the relationship between binding of CsA to cyclophilin and/or the 45 KD phosphoprotein and the immunosuppressive effects of CsA is still unknown.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) with dystonia-choreoathetosis is a common cause of disability in children and in adults, and responds poorly to medical treatment. Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (BP-DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is an effective treatment for primary dystonia, but the effect of this reversible surgical procedure on dystonia-choreoathetosis CP, which is a subtype of secondary dystonia, is unknown. Our aim was to test the effectiveness of BP-DBS in adults with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP. METHODS: We did a multicentre prospective pilot study of BP-DBS in 13 adults with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP who had no cognitive impairment, little spasticity, and only slight abnormalities of the basal ganglia on MRI. The primary endpoint was change in the severity of dystonia-choreoathetosis after 1 year of neurostimulation, as assessed with the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale. The accuracy of surgical targeting to the GPi was assessed masked to the results of neurostimulation. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: The mean Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale movement score improved from 44.2 (SD 21.1) before surgery to 34.7 (21.9) at 1 year post-operatively (p=0.009; mean improvement 24.4 [21.1]%, 95% CI 11.6-37.1). Functional disability, pain, and mental health-related quality of life were significantly improved. There was no worsening of cognition or mood. Adverse events were related to stimulation (arrest of the stimulator in one patient, and an adjustment to the current intensity in four patients). The optimum therapeutic target was the posterolateroventral region of the GPi. Little improvement was seen when the neurostimulation diffused to adjacent structures (mainly to the globus pallidus externus [GPe]). INTERPRETATION: Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP. However, given the heterogeneity of motor outcomes and the small sample size, results should be interpreted with caution. The optimum placement of the leads seemed to be a crucial, but not exclusive, factor that could affect a good outcome.

              "  'Molecular regulation of H3K4 trimethylation by Wdr82, a component of human Set1/COMPASS. In yeast, the macromolecular complex Set1/COMPASS is capable of methylating H3K4, a posttranslational modification associated with actively transcribed genes. There is only one Set1 in yeast; yet in mammalian cells there are multiple H3K4 methylases, including Set1A/B, forming human COMPASS complexes, and MLL1-4, forming human COMPASS-like complexes. We have shown that Wdr82, which associates with chromatin in a histone H2B ubiquitination-dependent manner, is a specific component of Set1 complexes but not that of MLL1-4 complexes. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Wdr82 results in a reduction in the H3K4 trimethylation levels, although these cells still possess active MLL complexes. Comprehensive in vitro enzymatic studies with Set1 and MLL complexes demonstrated that the Set1 complex is a more robust H3K4 trimethylase in vitro than the MLL complexes. Given our in vivo and in vitro observations, it appears that the human Set1 complex plays a more widespread role in H3K4 trimethylation than do the MLL complexes in mammalian cells.',\n",

The Philadelphia chromosome translocation (t(9;22)) results in the molecular juxtaposition of two genes, BCR and ABL, to form an aberrant BCR-ABL gene on chromosome 22. BCR-ABL is critical to the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and a subset of acute leukemias. The chimeric Bcr-Abl protein has constitutively elevated tyrosine phosphokinase activity. This abnormal enzymatic activation is critical to the oncogenic potential of Bcr-Abl. Initially, protein kinases were thought to be poor therapeutic targets because of their ubiquitous nature and crucial role in many normal physiologic processes. However, the advent of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), formerly known as STI571 and CGP57148B, demonstrated that designer kinase inhibitors could be specific. This agent has shown striking activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia. It also inhibits phosphorylation of Kit (stem-cell factor receptor) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. In addition, it has shown similar impressive responses, with little host toxicity, in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which harbor activating Kit mutations, and in tumors with activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The studies of imatinib mesylate provide proof-of-principle for using aberrant kinases as a therapeutic target and are a model for the promise of molecular therapeutics. This paper reviews the current knowledge on the function of Bcr-Abl and its normal counterparts (Bcr and Abl), as well as the impact of this knowledge on the development of a remarkably successful targeted therapy approach.',\n",
              "  'Lack of p53 affects the expression of several brain mitochondrial proteins: insights from proteomics into important pathways regulated by p53. The tumor suppressor protein p53 has been described \"as the guardian of the genome\" for its crucial role in regulating the transcription of numerous genes responsible for cells cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in response to various stress signals. Although p53 promotes longevity by decreasing the risk of cancer through activation of apoptosis or cellular senescence, several findings suggest that an increase of its activity may have deleterious effects leading to selected aspects of the aging phenotype and neurodegenerative diseases. There is the link between p53 and oxidative stress, the latter a crucial factor that contributes to neurodegenerative processes like Alzheimer disease (AD). In the present study, using a proteomics approach, we analyzed the impact of lack of p53 on the expression of several brain mitochondrial proteins involved in different pathways, and how lack of p53 may present a target to restore neuronal impairments. Our investigation on isolated brain mitochondria from p53((-/-)) mice also provides a better understanding of the p53-mitochondria relationship and its involvement in the development of many diseases.',\n",
              "  \"Acute effect on the Aβ isoform pattern in CSF in response to γ-secretase modulator and inhibitor treatment in dogs. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain, which is reflected by low concentration of the Aβ(1-42) peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The γ-secretase inhibitor LY450139 (semagacestat) lowers plasma Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) in a dose-dependent manner but has no clear effect on the CSF level of these isoforms. Less is known about the potent γ-secretase modulator E2012. Using targeted proteomics techniques, we recently identified several shorter Aβ isoforms in CSF, such as Aβ(1-16), which is produced by a novel pathway. In a Phase II clinical trial on AD patients, Aβ(1-14), Aβ(1-15) and Aβ(1-16) increased several-fold during γ-secretase inhibitor treatment. In the present study, 9 dogs were treated with a single dose of the γ-secretase modulator E2012, the γ-secretase inhibitor LY450139, or vehicle with a dosing interval of 1 week. The CSF Aβ isoform pattern was analyzed by immunoprecipitation combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We show here that Aβ(1-15) and Aβ(1-16) increase while Aβ(1-34) decreases in response to treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor LY450139, which is in agreement with previous studies. The isoform Aβ(1-37) was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to treatment with E2012, while Aβ(1-39), Aβ(1-40) and A(1-42) decreased. The data presented suggests that the γ-secretase modulator E-2012 alters the cleavage site preference of γ-secretase. The increase in Aβ(1-37) may inhibit Aβ(1-42) oligomerization and toxicity.\",\n",
              "  'Possible site of action of CGRP antagonists in migraine. BACKGROUND: The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists olcegepant and telcagepant are very potent drugs. Both are effective in migraine but in doses much higher than would be predicted from receptor binding and other in vitro results. This could perhaps suggest an effect of CGRP antagonists behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB), i.e. in the central nervous system (CNS). METHODS: Comparison of doses needed for CGRP blocking effect in vitro with dose needed in vivo in man and monkeys. Discussion of these doses in relation to doses needed for anti-migraine activity. RESULTS: In vivo studies in monkeys and man showed that high doses compared to doses needed in vitro are needed to block capsaicin-induced in skin blood flow, a CGRP-mediated reaction. These doses are close to those needed for anti-migraine activity. CONCLUSION: The apparently high doses of CGRP receptor antagonists, olcegepant and telcagepant needed for anti-migraine effect are not so high after all. They do not allow a conclusion as to whether CGRP antagonists act on peripheral sites or central sites in migraine.',\n",
              "  '[Heterogeneity of GTPase-activating proteins for Ras in the regulation of Ras signal transduction pathway]. The proto-oncogene ras is an essential gene for the growth and the differentiation for various types of cells. Ras, ras gene product, is a GTP binding protein which controls the signal transduction by GTP hydrolysis. The ras gene is frequently activated by point mutations in various types of human cancers, which results in a decrease in the GTPase activity of its product. A GTPase-activating protein p120 (p120GAP) was identified as a factor which stimulates the GTPase of normal ras gene product p21 but not of the mutated. An NF1 gene was identified as a gene whose loss of function causes an onset of human disorder, neurofibromatosis type I. The NF1 gene encodes a protein which contains a region with a similarity to the catalytic domain of p120GAP. We recently purified a novel Ras GAP whose molecular weight and immunogenecity are different from those of p120GAP and NF1. We named the novel mammalian Ras GAP as Gap1m. Isolation and sequencing of Gap1m cDNA revealed that Gap1m is indeed a novel Ras GAP. We also succeeded in isolation of another novel Ras GAP gene, GapIII/Gap1IP4BP, which is closely related to Gap1m. Recently, it is shown that GapIII/Gap1IP4BP binds inositol-tetrakis phosphate compounds. The overview of these Ras GAP molecules is described.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: The mechanistic link between Janus kinase (JAK) signaling and structural damage to arthritic joints in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is poorly understood. This study was undertaken to investigate how selective inhibition of JAK with tofacitinib (CP-690,550) affects osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model, as well as human T lymphocyte RANKL production and human osteoclast differentiation and function. METHODS: Hind paw edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in rat AIA were assessed using plethysmography, histopathologic analysis, and immunohistochemistry; plasma and hind paw tissue levels of cytokines and chemokines (including RANKL) were also assessed. In vitro RANKL production by activated human T lymphocytes was evaluated by immunoassay, while human osteoclast differentiation and function were assessed via quantitative tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and degradation of human bone collagen, respectively. RESULTS: Edema, inflammation, and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in rats with AIA were dramatically reduced after 7 days of treatment with the JAK inhibitor, which correlated with reduced numbers of CD68/ED-1+, CD3+, and RANKL+ cells in the paws; interleukin-6 (transcript and protein) levels were rapidly reduced in paw tissue within 4 hours of the first dose, whereas it took 4-7 days of therapy for RANKL levels to decrease. Tofacitinib did not impact human osteoclast differentiation or function, but did decrease human T lymphocyte RANKL production in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib suppresses osteoclast-mediated structural damage to arthritic joints, and this effect is secondary to decreased RANKL production.',\n",
              "  'Trends in inulinase production--a review. This article highlights the research work carried out in the production of inulinases from various inulin substrates using strains of bacteria, yeast and fungi. Inulin is one of the numerous polysaccharides of plant origin that contains glucose or fructose. It is used as a substrate in industrial fermentation processes and in food industries due to its relatively cheap and abundant source for the microbiological production of high-fructose syrups, ethanol and acetone-butanol. The various oligosaccharides derived from inulin also find their application in the medical and dietary sector. The inulinase acts on the beta-(2,1)-D-fructoside links in inulin releasing D-fructose. Hence, this article illustrates the capability of various microbes in hydrolyzing the carbon at its optimum nutrient concentration and operating condition towards inulinase production.',\n",
              "  'Genetics of pituitary adenomas. Pituitary adenomas are common tumors of the adenohypophysis which can cause considerable morbidity, due to excessive hormonal secretion or compression and local invasion of surrounding structures. The vast majority of pituitary adenomas occur sporadically. Altered gene expression is commonly detected but somatic mutations, epigenetic changes and abnormal microRNAs have also been described. Occurrence of GNAS mutations at a postzygotic stage lead to McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS), a disease causing endocrine hyperfunction and tumors in several organs, including the pituitary. Familial pituitary adenomas occur as part of a syndrome affecting other organs, such as in MEN1 or Carney complex, or occur with pituitary adenomas only as in familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA). FIPA, an autosomal-dominant disease with variable penetrance, is explained in 20% of patients by germline mutations in the tumor suppressor aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein(AIP), while no gene abnormality has been identified to date in the majority of the FIPA families. AIP mutation-positive patients have a characteristic clinical phenotype with usually young- or childhood-onset growth hormone (GH) and/or prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenomas and can be seen in cases with no apparent family history as well. Understanding the tumorigenic process in AIP-positive and AIP-negative FIPA patients could result in better diagnostic and treatment options for both familial and sporadic cases.',\n",
              "  'The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat alone, and in combination with trastuzumab, decreases the cancer stem cell population and self-renewal of HER2+ breast cancer cells. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumor progression, metastasis, and recurrence. HER2 overexpression is associated with increased CSCs, which may explain the aggressive phenotype and increased likelihood of recurrence for HER2(+) breast cancers. Telomerase is reactivated in tumor cells, including CSCs, but has limited activity in normal tissues, providing potential for telomerase inhibition in anti-cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC and non-CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines. The effects of imetelstat on CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cells were measured by ALDH activity and CD44/24 expression by flow cytometry as well as mammosphere assays for functionality. Combination studies in vitro and in vivo were utilized to test for synergism between imetelstat and trastuzumab. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Moreover, imetelstat alone and in combination with trastuzumab reduced the CSC fraction and inhibited CSC functional ability, as shown by decreased mammosphere counts and invasive potential. Tumor growth rate was slower in combination-treated mice compared to either drug alone. Additionally, there was a trend toward decreased CSC marker expression in imetelstat-treated xenograft cells compared to vehicle control. Furthermore, the observed decrease in CSC marker expression occurred prior to and after telomere shortening, suggesting that imetelstat acts on the CSC subpopulation in telomere length-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our study suggests addition of imetelstat to trastuzumab may enhance the effects of HER2 inhibition therapy, especially in the CSC population.',\n",
              "  'Fanconi anemia: at the crossroads of DNA repair. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal disorder that causes genome instability. FA patients suffer developmental abnormalities, early-onset bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to cancer. The disease is manifested by defects in DNA repair, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and a high degree of chromosomal aberrations. The FA pathway comprises 13 disease-causing genes involved in maintaining genomic stability. The fast pace of study of the novel DNA damage network has led to the constant discovery of new FA-like genes involved in the pathway that when mutated lead to similar disorders. A majority of the FA proteins act as signal transducers and scaffolding proteins to employ other pathways to repair DNA. This review discusses what is known about the FA proteins and other recently linked FA-like proteins. The goal is to clarify how the proteins work together to carry out interstrand crosslink repair and homologous recombination-mediated repair of damaged DNA.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory disorder characterised by chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia. The objectives of this study were to map, identify, and characterise the Majeed syndrome causal gene and to speculate on its function and role in skin and bone inflammation. METHODS: Six individuals with Majeed syndrome from two unrelated families were identified for this study. Homozygosity mapping and parametric linkage analysis were employed for the localisation of the gene responsible for Majeed syndrome. Direct sequencing was utilised for the identification of mutations within the genes contained in the region of linkage. Expression studies and in silico characterisation of the identified causal gene and its protein were carried out. RESULTS: The phenotype of Majeed syndrome includes inflammation of the bone and skin, recurrent fevers, and dyserythropoietic anaemia. The clinical picture of the six affected individuals is briefly reviewed. The gene was mapped to a 5.5 cM interval (1.8 Mb) on chromosome 18p. Examination of genes in this interval led to the identification of homozygous mutations in LPIN2 in affected individuals from the two families. LPIN2 was found to be expressed in almost all tissues. The function of LPIN2 and its role in inflammation remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that homozygous mutations in LPIN2 result in Majeed syndrome. Understanding the aberrant immune response in this condition will shed light on the aetiology of other inflammatory disorders of multifactorial aetiology including isolated chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, Sweet syndrome, and psoriasis.',\n",
              "  'SEA0400, a novel Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, reduces calcium overload induced by ischemia and reperfusion in mouse ventricular myocytes. Given the potential clinical benefit of inhibiting Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) activity during myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R), pharmacological approaches have been pursued to both inhibit and clarify the importance of this exchanger. SEA0400 was reported to have a potent NCX selectivity. Thus, we examined the effect of SEA0400 on NCX currents and I/R induced intracellular Ca2+ overload in mouse ventricular myocytes using patch clamp techniques and fluorescence measurements. Ischemia significantly inhibited inward and outward NCX current (from -0.04+/-0.01 nA to 0 nA at -100 mV; from 0.23+/-0.08 nA to 0.11+/-0.03 nA at +50 mV, n=7), Subsequent reperfusion not only restored the current rapidly but enhanced the current amplitude obviously, especially the outward currents (from 0.23+/-0.08 nA to 0.49+/-0.12 nA at +50 mV, n=7). [Ca2+]i, expressed as the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence intensity, increased to 138+/-7% (P<0.01) during ischemia and to 210+/-11% (P<0.01) after reperfusion. The change of NCX current and the increase of [Ca2+]i during I/R can be blocked by SEA0400 in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 31 nM and 28 nM for the inward and outward NCX current, respectively. The results suggested that SEA0400 is a potent NCX inhibitor, which can protect mouse cardiac myocytes from Ca2+ overload during I/R injuries.',\n",

Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disease with a high prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population but it is also present in other populations. The presence of eight mutations (1226G, 1448C, IVS2+1. 84GG, 1504T, 1604T, 1342C and 1297T) and the complete deletion of the beta-glucocerebrosidase gene was investigated in 25 unrelated non-Jewish patients with Gaucher's disease in Germany. In the Jewish population, three of these mutations account for more than 90% of all mutated alleles. In addition, relatives of two patients were included in our study. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of PCR products obtained from DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes was performed for mutation analysis. Gene deletion was detected by comparison of radioactively labelled PCR fragments of both the functional beta-glucocerebrosidase gene and the pseudogene. Among the unrelated patients, 50 alleles were investigated and the mutations identified in 35 alleles (70%), whereas 15 alleles (30%) remained unidentified. The most prevalent mutation in our group of patients was the 1226G (370Asn-->Ser) mutation, accounting for 18 alleles (36%), followed by the 1448C (444Lcu-->Pro) mutation, that was found in 12 alleles (24%). A complete gene deletion was present in two alleles (4%). The IVS1+2 (splicing mutation), the 1504T (463Arg-->Cys) as well as the 1342C (409Asp-->His) mutations were each present in one allele (2%). None of the alleles carried the 84GG (frame-shift), 1604A (496Arg-->His) or the 1297T (394Val-->Leu) mutation. This distribution is different from the Ashkenazi Jewish population but is similar to other Caucasian groups like the Spanish and Portuguese populations. Our results confirm the variability of mutation patterns in Gaucher patients of different ethnic origin. All patients were divided into nine groups according to their genotype and their clinical status was related to the individual genotype. Genotype/phenotype characteristics of the 1226G, 1448C, and 1342C mutations of previous studies were confirmed by our results.\",\n",
              "  'The neurofibromatoses: when less is more. The study of cancer predisposition syndromes presents unique opportunities to gain insights into the genetic events associated with tumor pathogenesis. Individuals with two inherited cancer syndromes, neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), develop both benign and malignant tumors. The corresponding genes mutated in these two disorders encode tumor suppressor proteins, termed neurofibromin (NF1) and merlin (NF2), which function in novel ways to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Neurofibromin inhibits cell proliferation, at least in part, by modulating mitogenic pathway signaling through inactivation of p21-ras. In contrast, merlin may act as a membrane-associated molecular switch that regulates cell-cell and cell-matrix signals transduced by cell surface receptors. Significant progress in our understanding of the genetics and biology of NF1 and NF2 has elucidated the roles of these genes in tumor initiation and progression.',\n",
              "  'Targeted chronic myeloid leukemia therapy: seeking a cure. BACKGROUND: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell cancer driven by the BCR-ABL fusion protein that arises from the translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22. The disease begins with an indolent chronic phase (CP) that can last for 3 to 5 years. If untreated, it progresses into accelerated phase (AP) and within a year, blast phase (BP). Survival at this point is less than 1 year. during disease progression, mutations and the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) appear (a process called clonal evolution). The only known curative therapy for CML is allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). However, toxicity is formidable, with treatment- related mortality reported in the 30% range. Thus, effective therapy that maintains the patient with CML in CP with minimal toxicity is the goal for treatment of modern therapies. Because the preeminent mutation driving CML is BCr-ABL, therapies targeting BCR-ABL are the logical choice for disease-specific therapy. BCR-ABL inhibitors, such as imatinib, are proof that targeting specific genetic mutations associated with cancer yields a high degree of efficacy with minimal toxicity. OBJECTIVE: This review will outline the evolution of therapy in CML. Preimatinib and imatinib-based treatment strategies, clinical efficacy, and the mechanism of imatinib resistance will be discussed. SUMMARY: The discovery of the Ph and, subsequently, the identification of BCr-ABL revolutionized the treatment of CML. Cytoreductive chemotherapy, such as busulfan and hydroxyurea, was a mainstay of therapy to control white blood cell (WBC) counts; however, it did not modify the progression of the disease to AP and BP. The overall survival with CML ranges from 45 to 58 months in patients treated with cytoreductive therapy only. Treatment was advanced with the introduction of interferon (IFn ) immunotherapy in the 1980s. In some studies, IFn produced a complete hematologic response (CHR) in more than 50% of patients; however, its nonspecific immunostimulatory mechanism also produced severe flulike symptoms that limited tolerability. despite the significant toxicity, cost, and inconvenience of injecting IFN thrice weekly, median survival ranged from 60 to 89 months. Allogeneic BMT is the only known curative therapy for CML; however, treatment-related mortality from infection, bleeding, and graft versus host disease, age, and the availability of suitable donors limits its widespread use. Imatinib functions by competing with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for binding to the BCr-ABL tyrosine kinase. In the absence of ATP, BCR-ABL is not able to activate downstream effector tyrosine kinase molecules that drive wBC proliferation. The International randomized Interferon versus STI571 clinical trial was the first to document the efficacy of imatinib as a first-line therapy for patients in CP. More than 90% of these patients had a CHr. Toxicities associated with this therapy are low. response in patients with advanced CML is less pronounced than in CP and is shorter lived, with less than 30% of patients achieving a CHR. For patients with CML in BP, the only viable therapy is to attempt a temporary reduction in disease burden with a salvage chemotherapy regimen, such as VAC (etoposide, cytarabine, and carboplatin). The goal of this induction chemotherapy is to induce a second remission; then the patient may be considered for allogeneic BMT. The main toxicities seen with imatinib therapy are myelosuppression, edema, and myalgia/arthralgia. In many cases, imatinib dosage can be briefly halted or lowered while the toxicity is managed. Imatinib resistance may develop at any time and inevitably leads to disease progression. resistance is usually caused by mutations within BCr-ABL, decreasing the affinity of imatinib binding. next-generation kinase inhibitors are focused on the ability to inhibit these mutated forms of BCR-ABL. CONCLUSION: For the majority of patients with CML in CP, the standard of care is to maintain the patient in CP with imatinib therapy. Clinical trials have been extraordinarily successful, with 5-year survival rates greater than 90%. Allogeneic BMT continues to be an option for those who cannot tolerate imatinib or when CML progresses on imatinib therapy.',\n",
              "  \"Histone modifications and lamin A regulate chromatin protein dynamics in early embryonic stem cell differentiation. Embryonic stem cells are characterized by unique epigenetic features including decondensed chromatin and hyperdynamic association of chromatin proteins with chromatin. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms that regulate chromatin plasticity in embryonic stem cells. Using epigenetic drugs and mutant embryonic stem cells lacking various chromatin proteins, we find that histone acetylation, G9a-mediated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation and lamin A expression, all affect chromatin protein dynamics. Histone acetylation controls, almost exclusively, euchromatin protein dynamics; lamin A expression regulates heterochromatin protein dynamics, and G9a regulates both euchromatin and heterochromatin protein dynamics. In contrast, we find that DNA methylation and nucleosome repeat length have little or no effect on chromatin-binding protein dynamics in embryonic stem cells. Altered chromatin dynamics associates with perturbed embryonic stem cell differentiation. Together, these data provide mechanistic insights into the epigenetic pathways that are responsible for chromatin plasticity in embryonic stem cells, and indicate that the genome's epigenetic state modulates chromatin plasticity and differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells.\",\n",

Pathological expansions of GAA repeats in the first intron of the frataxin gene cause most cases of Friedreich ataxia, a progressively debilitating neurodegenerative disease. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and the GAA repeats are suspected to form unusual non B-DNA conformations that decrease transcription and subsequently reduce levels of the encoded protein, frataxin. Recent work has shown that GAA repeats induce heterochromatin formation and silencing of the frataxin gene locus. Frataxin plays a crucial role in iron metabolism and detoxification and interacts with electron transport chain proteins. Clinical trials are currently underway to examine the efficacy of antioxidants in the treatment of Friedreich ataxia, but therapeutics designed to increase frataxin message levels are still in the developmental stages. This review will focus on the progress of potential treatment strategies for Friedreich ataxia that target the GAA expanded gene and seek to increase the level of frataxin message and protein.',\n",

              "  'JAK1 activates STAT3 activity in non-small-cell lung cancer cells and IL-6 neutralizing antibodies can suppress JAK1-STAT3 signaling. Members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors are potential targets for the treatment and prevention of cancers including non-small-cell lung cancer. STAT proteins can be phosphorylated and activated by diverse upstream kinases including cytokine receptors and tyrosine kinases. We examined STAT protein activation in lung cancer cell lines including those with activating mutations in the EGFR and examined upstream kinases responsible for STAT3 phosphorylation and activation using small molecules, antibodies, and RNA interference. We found more pronounced STAT3 activation in cells with activating EGFR mutations, yet inhibition of EGFR activity had no effect on STAT3 activation. Inhibition of JAK1 with small molecules or RNA interference resulted in loss of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of cell growth. An interleukin-6 neutralizing antibody, siltuximab (CNTO 328) could inhibit STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in a cell-dependent manner. Siltuximab could completely inhibit STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation in H1650 cells, and this resulted in inhibition of lung cancer cell growth in vivo. Combined EGFR inhibition with erlotinib and siltuximab resulted in dual inhibition of both tyrosine and serine STAT3 phosphorylation, more pronounced inhibition of STAT3 transcriptional activity, and translated into combined effects on lung cancer growth in a mouse model. Our results suggest that JAK1 is responsible for STAT3 activation in lung cancer cells and that indirect attacks on JAK1-STAT3 using an IL-6 neutralizing antibody with or without EGFR inhibition can inhibit lung cancer growth in lung cancer subsets.',\n",
              "  'Fanconi anemia protein, FANCA, associates with BRG1, a component of the human SWI/SNF complex. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder that predisposes to hematopoietic failure, birth defects and cancer. We identified an interaction between the FA protein, FANCA and brm-related gene 1 (BRG1) product. BRG1 is a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, which remodels chromatin structure through a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. FANCA was demonstrated to associate with the endogenous SWI/SNF complex. We also found a significant increase in the molecular chaperone, glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) among BRG1-associated factors isolated from a FANCA-mutant cell line, which was not seen in either a normal control cell line or the mutant line complemented by wild-type FANCA. Despite this specific difference, FANCA did not appear to be absolutely required for in vitro chromatin remodeling. Finally, we demonstrated co-localization in the nucleus between transfected FANCA and BRG1. The physiological action of FANCA on the SWI/SNF complex remains to be clarified, but our work suggests that FANCA may recruit the SWI/SNF complex to target genes, thereby enabling coupled nuclear functions such as transcription and DNA repair.',\n",
              "  'Analysis of amino acid 13C abundance from human and faunal bone collagen using liquid chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The scope of compound-specific stable isotope analysis has recently been increased with the development of the LC IsoLink which interfaces high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to provide online LC/IRMS. This enables isotopic measurement of non-volatile compounds previously not amenable to compound-specific analysis or requiring substantial modification for gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS), which results in reduced precision. Amino acids are an example of such compounds. We present a new chromatographic method for the HPLC separation of underivatized amino acids using an acidic, aqueous mobile phase in conjunction with a mixed-mode stationary phase that can be interfaced with the LC IsoLink for compound-specific delta13C analysis. The method utilizes a reversed-phase Primesep-A column with embedded, ionizable, functional groups providing the capability for ion-exchange and hydrophobic interactions. Baseline separation of 15 amino acids and their carbon isotope values are reported with an average standard deviation of 0.18 per thousand (n = 6). In addition delta13C values of 18 amino acids are determined from modern protein and archaeological bone collagen hydrolysates, demonstrating the potential of this method for compound-specific applications in a number of fields including metabolic, ecological and palaeodietary studies.',\n",

The inflammatory cytokine IL-1β has an essential role in the innate immune response. High levels of IL-1β have been implicated in the development of many diseases, including type 1 and 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cardiovascular disease. XOMA is developing gevokizumab (XOMA-052), an IgG2 humanized mAb against human IL-1β, for the potential treatment of these diseases. Gevokizumab has a high affinity for IL-1β and a long t1/2, which would allow for once-monthly dosing and offer a considerable advantage for patients over agents requiring more frequent dosing. Data from preclinical studies and clinical trials suggest that gevokizumab is a potentially effective and well-tolerated treatment for the indicated diseases. At the time of publication, phase II clinical trials were ongoing in patients with T1D, T2D and RA, with the T2D trials assessing key cardiovascular markers. Following promising data from a recent pilot trial, XOMA was also planning a phase I/II trial of gevokizumab for the potential treatment of uveitis in patients with the vasculitic inflammatory disorder Behçet's disease and the autoinflammatory conditions familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and Muckle-Wells syndrome.\",\n",
              "  \"Hypoxia-inducing factors as master regulators of stemness properties and altered metabolism of cancer- and metastasis-initiating cells. Accumulating lines of experimental evidence have revealed that hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, are key regulators of the adaptation of cancer- and metastasis-initiating cells and their differentiated progenies to oxygen and nutrient deprivation during cancer progression under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Particularly, the sustained stimulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), stem cell factor (SCF) receptor KIT, transforming growth factor-β receptors (TGF-βRs) and Notch and their downstream signalling elements such as phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) may lead to an enhanced activity of HIFs. Moreover, the up-regulation of HIFs in cancer cells may also occur in the hypoxic intratumoral regions formed within primary and secondary neoplasms as well as in leukaemic cells and metastatic prostate and breast cancer cells homing in the hypoxic endosteal niche of bone marrow. The activated HIFs may induce the expression of numerous gene products such as induced pluripotency-associated transcription factors (Oct-3/4, Nanog and Sox-2), glycolysis- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programme-associated molecules, including CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), snail and twist, microRNAs and angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These gene products in turn can play critical roles for high self-renewal ability, survival, altered energy metabolism, invasion and metastases of cancer cells, angiogenic switch and treatment resistance. Consequently, the targeting of HIF signalling network and altered metabolic pathways represents new promising strategies to eradicate the total mass of cancer cells and improve the efficacy of current therapies against aggressive and metastatic cancers and prevent disease relapse.\",\n",
              "  'Practical use of dabigatran etexilate for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, and is the most prevalent factor for cardioembolic stroke. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with AF since the early 1990s. They are very effective for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke, but are limited by factors such as drug-drug interactions, food interactions, slow onset and offset of action, haemorrhage and need for routine anticoagulation monitoring to maintain a therapeutic international normalised ratio (INR). Multiple new oral anticoagulants have been developed as potential replacements for VKAs for stroke prevention in AF. Most are small synthetic molecules that target thrombin (e.g. dabigatran etexilate) or factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, YM150). These drugs have predictable pharmacokinetics that allow fixed dosing without routine laboratory monitoring. Dabigatran etexilate, the first of these new oral anticoagulants to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF, represents an effective and safe alternative to VKAs. Under the auspices of the Regional Anticoagulation Working Group, a multidisciplinary group of experts in thrombosis and haemostasis from Central and Eastern Europe, an expert panel with expertise in AF convened to discuss practical, clinically important issues related to the long-term use of dabigatran for stroke prevention in non-valvular AF. The practical information reviewed in this article will help clinicians make appropriate use of this new therapeutic option in daily clinical practice.',\n",
              "  'Signalling to transcription: store-operated Ca2+ entry and NFAT activation in lymphocytes. In cells of the immune system that are stimulated by antigen or antigen-antibody complexes, Ca(2+) entry from the extracellular medium is driven by depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores and occurs through specialized store-operated Ca(2+) channels known as Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels. The process of store-operated Ca(2+) influx is essential for short-term as well as long-term responses by immune-system cells. Short-term responses include mast cell degranulation and killing of target cells by effector cytolytic T cells, whereas long-term responses typically involve changes in gene transcription and include T and B cell proliferation and differentiation. Transcription downstream of Ca(2+) influx is in large part funneled through the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), a heavily phosphorylated protein that is cytoplasmic in resting cells, but that enters the nucleus when dephosphorylated by the calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. The importance of the Ca(2+)/calcineurin/NFAT signalling pathway for lymphocyte activation is underscored by the finding that the underlying defect in a family with a hereditary severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) syndrome is a defect in CRAC channel function, store-operated Ca(2+) entry, NFAT activation and transcription of cytokines, chemokines and many other NFAT target genes whose transcription is essential for productive immune defence. We recently used a two-pronged genetic approach to identify Orai1 as the pore subunit of the CRAC channel. On the one hand, we initiated a positional cloning approach in which we utilised genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping to identify the genomic region linked to the mutant gene in the SCID family described above. In parallel, we used a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila to identify critical regulators of NFAT nuclear translocation and store-operated Ca(2+) entry. These approaches, together with subsequent mutational and electrophysiological analyses, converged to identify human Orai1 as a pore subunit of the CRAC channel and as the gene product mutated in the SCID patients.',\n",
              "  'Glivec and CML: a lucky date. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) has always been an ideal model to understand the molecular pathogenesis of human leukaemias and the way to cure them. This can be ascribed to the fact that CML was the first human cancer demonstrated to be strongly associated to the presence of a recurrent chromosomal translocation (the t(9;22)(q34;q11) that creates the Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome) and to a specific molecular defect, the formation of a hybrid BCR-ABL gene that generates new fusion proteins endowed with a constitutive tyrosine-kinase (TK) activity, strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. The introduction into clinical practice of imatinib, (Glivec, Gleevec, Novartis), a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl protein as well as of a restricted number of other TKs, has not only produced a substantial improvement in the treatment of CML, but represents a major break-through in the perspective of opening a new era, that of molecularly targeted therapy, in the management of other types of leukemia, lymphoma and cancer in general.',\n",
              "  \"Genomic context analysis reveals dense interaction network between vertebrate ultraconserved non-coding elements. MOTIVATION: Genomic context analysis, also known as phylogenetic profiling, is widely used to infer functional interactions between proteins but rarely applied to non-coding cis-regulatory DNA elements. We were wondering whether this approach could provide insights about utlraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). These elements are organized as large clusters, so-called gene regulatory blocks (GRBs) around key developmental genes. Their molecular functions and the reasons for their high degree of conservation remain enigmatic. RESULTS: In a special setting of genomic context analysis, we analyzed the fate of GRBs after a whole-genome duplication event in five fish genomes. We found that in most cases all UCNEs were retained together as a single block, whereas the corresponding target genes were often retained in two copies, one completely devoid of UCNEs. This 'winner-takes-all' pattern suggests that UCNEs of a GRB function in a highly cooperative manner. We propose that the multitude of interactions between UCNEs is the reason for their extreme sequence conservation.

              "  \"Tofacitinib: The First Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety, dosage administration, and adverse effects of tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. DATA SOURCES: Primary sources of information were obtained from clinical studies, which were identified through PubMed (1966 to June 2013) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to March 2013) using terms: tofacitinib, tasocitinib, CP-690550, and CP-690,550. Information was used from tofacitinib package insert, guidelines, and published abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Data search was limited to include publications in English language and from human subjects. DATA SYNTHESIS: Tofacitinib is the first oral Janus kinase inhibitor indicated for treatment of moderate to severe RA. Tofacitinib demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Tofacitinib was efficacious in RA patients, indicated by achievements of ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 criteria. Similar improvements were observed in patients who met remission criteria based on the Disease Activity Scores 28 criteria and quality of life as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Tofacitinib was associated with infections and malignancies; and elevations in serum creatinine and lipids were observed. Drug interactions with inducers and inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 3A4 and 2C9 isoenzymes were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib is an oral treatment option for RA patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. Postmarket surveillance will provide further insight to tofacitinib's role in RA therapy, especially in patients who may require different types of combination therapy with DMARDS.\",\n",
              "  'Resolving the daratumumab interference with blood compatibility testing. BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myeloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells. During routine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a positive antibody screen and panreactivity on red blood cell (RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized that the observed panreactivity reflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs, and we investigated methods to prevent this binding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. To remove cell surface CD38, cells were incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) or trypsin. Soluble CD38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA in solution. Routine blood bank serologic methods were used to test samples from DARA-treated patients and normal plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HL60 cells, but not to CD38- controls. DTT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA binding by 92% by denaturing cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DTT is a robust method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patients. Because DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are provided to these patients.',\n",
              "  'Genetics and phenomics of Pendred syndrome. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, goiter and a partial defect in iodide organification. Goiter development and hypothyroidism vary and appear to depend on nutritional iodide intake. Pendred syndrome is caused by biallelic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, which encodes pendrin, a multifunctional anion exchanger. Pendrin is mainly expressed in the thyroid, the inner ear, and the kidney. In the thyroid, pendrin localizes to the apical membrane of thyrocytes, where it may be involved in mediating iodide efflux. Loss-of-function mutations in the SLC26A4 gene are associated with a partial iodide organification defect, presumably because of a reduced iodide efflux into the follicular lumen. In the kidney, pendrin functions as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. In the inner ear, pendrin is important in the maintenance of a normal anion transport and the endocochlear potential. Elucidation of the function of pendrin has provided unexpected novel insights into the pathophysiology of thyroid hormone biosynthesis, chloride retention in the kidney, and composition of the endolymph.',\n",

              "  'The Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale: development and validation of a stroke recognition instrument. BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.',\n",

Oral pregabalin, a calcium channel alpha(2)delta-subunit ligand with analgesic, anxiolytic and antiepileptic activity, has shown efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia. It has a multidimensional effect in the treatment of this complex condition, and is associated with rapid and clinically significant improvements in several outcome measures relating to core symptoms of the syndrome, including pain and sleep, in patients with long-standing fibromyalgia. Pregabalin treatment is also associated with improvements in the overall health status of these patients. The beneficial effects of pregabalin are durable in patients with an initial response to the drug. The most common adverse events associated with the drug are dizziness and somnolence, which are generally mild to moderate in intensity and are tolerated by many patients. Pregabalin is, therefore, a valuable option in the first-line treatment of patients with fibromyalgia.',\n",

Mitotic regulators exhibiting gain of function in tumor cells are considered useful cancer therapeutic targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors. The human Aurora kinases are a family of such targets. In this study, from a panel of 105 potential small-molecule inhibitors, two compounds Tripolin A and Tripolin B, inhibited Aurora A kinase activity in vitro. In human cells however, only Tripolin A acted as an Aurora A inhibitor. We combined in vitro, in vivo single cell and in silico studies to demonstrate the biological action of Tripolin A, a non-ATP competitive inhibitor. Tripolin A reduced the localization of pAurora A on spindle microtubules (MTs), affected centrosome integrity, spindle formation and length, as well as MT dynamics in interphase, consistent with Aurora A inhibition by RNAi or other specific inhibitors, such as MLN8054 or MLN8237. Interestingly, Tripolin A affected the gradient distribution towards the chromosomes, but not the MT binding of HURP (Hepatoma Up-Regulated Protein), a MT-associated protein (MAP) and substrate of the Aurora A kinase. Therefore Tripolin A reveals a new way of regulating mitotic MT stabilizers through Aurora A phosphorylation. Tripolin A is predicted to bind Aurora A similarly but not identical to MLN8054, therefore it could be used to dissect pathways orchestrated by Aurora kinases as well as a scaffold for further inhibitor development.\",\n",
              "  'Nucleotide excision repair and its interplay with transcription. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a multistep process capable to remove a variety of DNA distorting lesions from prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. In eukaryotic cells, the process requires more than 30 proteins to perform the different steps, i.e. recognition of DNA damage, single strand incisions and excision of the lesion-containing DNA fragment and DNA repair synthesis/ligation. NER can operate via two subpathways: global genome repair (GGR) and a specialized pathway coupled to active transcription (transcription-coupled repair, TCR) and directed to DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes. Both in vivo as well as in cultured cells the fast removal of transcription blocking lesions by TCR is crucial to escape from lethal effects of inhibited transcription inhibition The most delicate step in NER is the recognition of the DNA lesions in their different chromatin context and the mechanism of damage recognition in GGR and TCR is principally different and requires specific proteins. In GGR, the XPC-HR23B is essential for the formation of the incision complex. In TCR the Cockayne syndrome (CS) gene products are key players in the recognition of a stalled RNA polymerase the presumed signaling structure for repair of transcribed strands. In this study, we show that the extent of recovery of UV-inhibited transcription and TCR strictly depends on the amount of CSB protein as well as the amount of DNA damage present in the cell. This indicates that the ratio between DNA damage frequency and CSB protein concentration in the cell is rather critical for acute cellular response, i.e. recovery of inhibited transcription upon DNA damage infliction, and hence cellular survival.',\n",
              "  \"The 5' → 3' exoribonuclease XRN1/Pacman and its functions in cellular processes and development. XRN1 is a 5' → 3' processive exoribonuclease that degrades mRNAs after they have been decapped. It is highly conserved in all eukaryotes, including homologs in Drosophila melanogaster (Pacman), Caenorhabditis elegans (XRN1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Xrn1p). As well as being a key enzyme in RNA turnover, XRN1 is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and degradation of mRNAs after they have been targeted by small interfering RNAs or microRNAs. The crystal structure of XRN1 can explain its processivity and also the selectivity of the enzyme for 5' monophosphorylated RNA. In eukaryotic cells, XRN1 is often found in particles known as processing bodies (P bodies) together with other proteins involved in the 5' → 3' degradation pathway, such as DCP2 and the helicase DHH1 (Me31B). Although XRN1 shows little specificity to particular 5' monophosphorylated RNAs in vitro, mutations in XRN1 in vivo have specific phenotypes suggesting that it specifically degrades a subset of RNAs. In Drosophila, mutations in the gene encoding the XRN1 homolog pacman result in defects in wound healing, epithelial closure and stem cell renewal in testes. We propose a model where specific mRNAs are targeted to XRN1 via specific binding of miRNAs and/or RNA-binding proteins to instability elements within the RNA. These guide the RNA to the 5' core degradation apparatus for controlled degradation.\",\n",

MLN4924 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. MLN4924 is a mechanism-based inhibitor, with enzyme inhibition occurring through the formation of a tight-binding NEDD8-MLN4924 adduct. In cell and xenograft models of cancer, we identified treatment-emergent heterozygous mutations in the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket and NEDD8-binding cleft of NAEβ as the primary mechanism of resistance to MLN4924. Biochemical analyses of NAEβ mutants revealed slower rates of adduct formation and reduced adduct affinity for the mutant enzymes. A compound with tighter binding properties was able to potently inhibit mutant enzymes in cells. These data provide rationales for patient selection and the development of next-generation NAE inhibitors designed to overcome treatment-emergent NAEβ mutations.',\n",

The blockage of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) at a DNA damage site on the transcribed strand triggers a transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR), which rapidly removes DNA damage on the transcribed strand of the expressed gene and allows the resumption of transcription. To analyze the effect of UV-induced DNA damage on transcription elongation, an in vitro transcription elongation system using pol II and oligo(dC)-tailed templates containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) or 6-4 photoproduct (6-4PP) at a specific site was employed. The results showed that pol II incorporated nucleotides opposite the CPD and 6-4PP and then stalled. Pol II formed a stable ternary complex consisting of pol II, the DNA damage template, and the nascent transcript. Furthermore, atomic force microscopy imaging revealed that pol II stalled at the damaged region. These findings may provide the basis for analysis of the initiation step of TCR.',\n",

Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by defective function of the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein CLN3. The activity of the lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP/ACP2) was found to be significantly increased in the cerebellum and brain stem of Cln3-targeted mice during the early stages of postnatal life. Histochemical localization studies revealed an increased LAP/ACP2 staining intensity in neurons of the cerebral cortex of 48-week-old Cln3-targeted mice as compared with controls. Additionally, the expression of another lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-2 was increased in all brain areas. Knockdown of CLN3 expression in HeLa cells by RNA interference also resulted in increased LAP/ACP2 and LAMP-2 expression. Finally in fibroblasts of two juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis patients elevated levels of LAP/ACP2 were found. Both activation of gene transcription and increased protein half-life appear to contribute to increased LAP/ACP2 protein expression in CLN3-deficient cells. The data suggest that lysosomal dysfunction and accumulation of storage material require increased biogenesis of LAP/ACP2 and LAMP-2 positive membranes which makes LAP/ACP2 suitable as biomarker of Batten disease.',\n",

These data are critical to get a deeper insight into the effects of such adjuvant therapy in GBM patients. In the present study, various doses of rapamycin were tested in primary cell cultures from GBM patients. These effects were compared with that obtained by the same doses of rapamycin in GBM cell lines (U87Mg). The effects of rapamycin were also evaluated in vivo, in brain tumors developed from mouse xenografts. Rapamycin, starting at the dose of 10nm inhibited cell growth both in U87Mg cell line and primary cell cultures derived from various GBM patients. When administered in vivo to brain xenografts in nude mice rapamycin almost doubled the survival time of mice and inhibited by more than 95% of tumor volume.',\n",
              "  \"[Gaucher's disease uncovered late]. Gaucher's disease is an uncommon inborn recessive autosomal disease, due to a deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta glucocerebrosidase. This disease is usually diagnosed in the first or second decade of life with the arising of bone pains, splenomegaly and hemorragic manifestations due to thrombocytopenia. When the enlarged spleen is not evident, or after splenectomy, patients may be mis-identified as having Gaucher's disease. We present here two cases of elderly patients aged 70 and 46 years respectively, in whom the disease was a surprising finding of bone marrow examination, during check up for pancytopenia.\",\n",
              "  'Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal. BACKGROUND: Specific reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are lacking. Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. METHODS: We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after the administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the determination at a central laboratory of the dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time. A key secondary end point was the restoration of hemostasis. RESULTS: This interim analysis included 90 patients who received idarucizumab (51 patients in group A and 39 in group B). Among 68 patients with an elevated dilute thrombin time and 81 with an elevated ecarin clotting time at baseline, the median maximum percentage reversal was 100% (95% confidence interval, 100 to 100). Idarucizumab normalized the test results in 88 to 98% of the patients, an effect that was evident within minutes. Concentrations of unbound dabigatran remained below 20 ng per milliliter at 24 hours in 79% of the patients. Among 35 patients in group A who could be assessed, hemostasis, as determined by local investigators, was restored at a median of 11.4 hours. Among 36 patients in group B who underwent a procedure, normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported in 33, and mildly or moderately abnormal hemostasis was reported in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after idarucizumab administration in a patient in whom anticoagulants had not been reinitiated. CONCLUSIONS: Idarucizumab completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within minutes. (Funded by Boehringer Ingelheim; RE-VERSE AD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02104947.).',\n",
              "  'Compound heterozygous mutations in KvLQT1 cause Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is characterized by sensorineural deafness, QT prolongation, abnormal T waves, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and autosomal recessive inheritance. Previously homozygous mutations in the potassium channel-encoding genes, KvLQT1 (alpha-subunit) and KCNE1 (beta-subunit), have been described in consanguineous families with JLNS. We screened two nonconsanguineous families with JLNS for mutations in KvLQT1, using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and DNA sequencing. In one family, a missense mutation was identified in exon 6 of KvLQT1 on the maternal side, resulting in a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at codon 269 (G269D). The apparently normal father had an incompletely penetrant missense mutation in exon 3 of KvLQT1, introducing a premature stop codon at position 171. In the other family, a missense mutation resulting in the substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at codon 202 (D202N) was identified in the mother and maternal grandmother, who had QTc prolongation (borderline in the mother), while the father and paternal grandfather, who were clinically normal, had a deletion of nucleotide 585, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination. In both families, the proband inherited both mutations. In this report we provide evidence that not only homozygous but also compound heterozygous mutations in KvLQT1 may cause JLNS in nonconsanguineous families. Incomplete penetrance in individuals with mutations appears to be frequent, indicating a higher prevalence of mutations than estimated previously. Interestingly, mutations resulting in truncation of the protein appear to be benign, with heterozygous carriers being asymptomatic.',\n",

Serum IgA class antigliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA) are increased in untreated patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and it has been suggested that salivary IgA-AGA measurements could be used as a non-invasive screening test for gluten-sensitive enteropathy. In the present study salivary and serum IgA-AGA were measured by an ELISA test in 10 untreated patients with DH. The results were compared to IgA-AGA levels in nine patients with DH on a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) and in 20 healthy control subjects on an ordinary diet. The mean serum but not salivary IgA-AGA concentrations were significantly higher in the untreated than in the patients with DH on a long-term GFD. When the 10 untreated patients with DH adhered to a GFD for 3 months, the rash disappeared and the mean serum IgA-AGA decreased to normal levels, but no change was found in the mean salivary IgA-AGA concentration. These results show that serum but not salivary IgA-AGA measurements are suitable for monitoring GFD treatment in patients with DH. The discrepancy between the serum and salivary IgA-AGA concentrations suggests that systemic and salivary IgA-AGA responses are controlled separately.',\n",
              "  'Imatinib and nilotinib inhibit hematopoietic progenitor cell growth, but do not prevent adhesion, migration and engraftment of human cord blood CD34+ cells. BACKGROUND: The availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has considerably changed the management of Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemia. The BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib is also known to inhibit the tyrosine kinase of the stem cell factor receptor, c-Kit. Nilotinib is 30 times more potent than imatinib towards BCR-ABL in vitro. Studies in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors have shown that therapeutic doses of nilotinib deliver drug levels similar to those of imatinib. The aim of this study was to compare the inhibitory effects of imatinib and nilotinib on proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration and engraftment capacities of human cord blood CD34(+) cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: After a 48-hour cell culture with or without TKIs, CFC, LTC-IC, migration, adhesion and cell cycle analysis were performed. In a second time, the impact of these TKIs on engraftment was assessed in a xenotransplantation model using NOD/SCID/IL-2Rγ (null) mice. RESULTS: TKIs did not affect LTC-IC frequencies despite in vitro inhibition of CFC formation due to inhibition of CD34(+) cell cycle entry. Adhesion of CD34(+) cells to retronectin was reduced in the presence of either imatinib or nilotinib but only at high concentrations. Migration through a SDF-1α gradient was not changed by cell culture in the presence of TKIs. Finally, bone marrow cellularity and human chimerism were not affected by daily doses of imatinib and nilotinib in a xenogenic transplantation model. No significant difference was seen between TKIs given the equivalent affinity of imatinib and nilotinib for KIT. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that combining non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with TKIs starting the day of the transplantation could be safe.',\n",
              "  \"The pharmacoepidemiology of antipsychotics for adults with schizophrenia in Canada, 2005 to 2009. OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency and trends in the use of antipsychotics for adults with schizophrenia in Canada from 2005 to 2009. METHODS: Analyses were performed on IMS Brogan's Canadian Disease and Therapeutic Index (CDTI). The CDTI is a national physician panel study consisting of a representative sample of physicians both geographically and by specialty. Weighting adjustments are made to estimate national drug recommendations. Quarterly, panel physicians record all therapeutic recommendations during a 2-day period, including patient age, sex, and indication. Antipsychotic recommendations were estimated using CDTI data in which schizophrenia was listed as the indication. RESULTS: First-generation antipsychotic (FGA) recommendations for adults with schizophrenia increased by 38% between 2005 and 2009, from 329 380 to 454 960 recommendations. There were notable increases in recommendations for chlorpromazine, loxapine, zuclopenthixol, and flupentixol. Second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) recommendations increased to a much lesser extent (9%), which was mostly attributable to an increase in recommendations for clozapine. Drug recommendations for olanzapine decreased by 9%. CONCLUSION: The rate of increase of FGA use is now greater than that of SGAs. This may be due to data from recent comparative trials, which suggest that clinical efficacy, and the rate of neurological side effects is similar between FGAs and SGAs. The decreasing use of olanzapine may be due to metabolic adverse effects. The increased use of clozapine may be due to data on its superiority in patients who are treatment resistant.\",\n",

Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a T cell co-inhibitory receptor with two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In cancer, this pathway plays a major role in immune resistance in the tumor environment. Blockade of this pathway can enhance antitumor immune responses. This review discusses the preclinical rationale for PD-1 pathway inhibition in advanced renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer, in addition to the clinical activity and toxicity of the anti-PD-L1 antibody BMS-936559, as well as anti-PD-1 antibodies MK-3475 and BMS-936558.',\n",

We report a case of paraneoplastic myasthenic syndrome with clinical features suggesting Lambert Eaton syndrome but without the electromyographic elements required for diagnosis. Anti-calcium channel antibodies were also lacking. The electromyogram evidenced a block and the Tensilon test was positive. The efficacy of anticholinesterases argued in favor of myasthenia but anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative. The block was more of a mixed nature, involving both presynaptic transmission as in Lambert Eaton syndrome and post-synaptic transmission as in paraneoplastic myasthenia. The primary tumor was identified as a small-cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma on mediastinal biopsies obtained directly on CT-scan guided puncture of a mediastinal node. Thoracotomy was thus avoided. The Lambert Eaton syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation of small-cell lung cancer in 50% of the cases unlike generalized myasthenia which apparently is never associated with small-cell lung cancer. A mixed paraneoplastic neuro-muscle junction disorder with aspects of each can be exceptionally observed.',\n",
              "  'Tolerance to oats in dermatitis herpetiformis. OBJECTIVES: Recent studies on coeliac disease have shown that oats can be included in a gluten-free diet without adverse effects on the small bowel. The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats. PATIENTS/METHODS: Eleven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in remission on a gluten-free diet were challenged daily with 50 g oats for six months. Clinical symptoms were recorded, serum samples taken, and skin and small bowel biopsies performed before and after the oat challenge. A control group comprised of 11 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a conventional gluten-free diet was also studied. RESULTS: Eight patients challenged with oats remained asymptomatic, two developed a transient rash, and one withdrew because of the appearance of a more persistent but mild rash. Three of the 11 controls also developed a transient rash. IgA endomysial antibodies remained negative in all patients. The small bowel villous architecture, the densities of intraepithelial CD3 and alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cell receptor positive lymphocytes and crypt epithelial cell DR expression remained unaltered during the oat challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the absence of oat toxicity on the gluten sensitive small bowel mucosa and suggest that the rash in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis is not activated by eating oats.',\n",
              "  'The structure of NSD1 reveals an autoregulatory mechanism underlying histone H3K36 methylation. The Sotos syndrome gene product, NSD1, is a SET domain histone methyltransferase that primarily dimethylates nucleosomal histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36). To date, the intrinsic properties of NSD1 that determine its nucleosomal substrate selectivity and dimethyl H3K36 product specificity remain unknown. The 1.7 Å structure of the catalytic domain of NSD1 presented here shows that a regulatory loop adopts a conformation that prevents free access of H3K36 to the bound S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Molecular dynamics simulation and computational docking revealed that this normally inhibitory loop can adopt an active conformation, allowing H3K36 access to the active site, and that the nucleosome may stabilize the active conformation of the regulatory loop. Hence, our study reveals an autoregulatory mechanism of NSD1 and provides insight into the molecular mechanism of the nucleosomal substrate selectivity of this disease-related H3K36 methyltransferase.',\n",
              "  \"In vitro and in vivo analysis of a JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis. Multiple cytokines play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The appropriate intracellular signalling pathways must be activated via cytokine receptors on the cell surface, and the tyrosine kinases transduce the first 'outside to in' signals to be phosphorylated after receptor binding to its ligand. Among them, members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family are essential for the signalling pathways of various cytokines and are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. The in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo effects of a JAK inhibitor CP-690,550 (tofacitinib) for the treatment of RA are reported. In vitro experiments indicated that the effects of tofacitinib were mediated through suppression of interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon γ production and proliferation of CD4 T cells, presumably Th1 and Th17. A treatment study was conducted in the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-HuRAg mice, an RA animal model using SCID mice implanted with synovium and cartilage from patients. Tofacitinib reduced serum levels of human IL-6 and IL-8 in the mice and also reduced synovial inflammation and invasion into the implanted cartilage. A phase 2 double-blind study using tofacitinib was carried out in Japanese patients with active RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). A total of 140 patients were randomised to tofacitinib 1, 3, 5, 10 mg or placebo twice daily and the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response rate at week 12, a primary end point, was significant for all tofacitinib treatment groups. Thus, an orally available tofacitinib in combination with MTX was efficacious and had a manageable safety profile. Tofacitinib at 5 and 10 mg twice a day appears suitable for further evaluation to optimise the treatment of RA.\",\n",

As part of the road widening scheme between London and Dover, Oxford Archaeology South uncovered a large boundary ditch of Iron Age origin that contained Iron Age and Roman inhumations, adjacent to which was a small mid-late Roman cemetery, interpreted as a rural cemetery for Romano-British farmers. Grave goods in the cemetery were restricted to a few individuals with hobnailed boots. Bulk bone collagen isotopic analysis of 11 skeletons of Iron Age and Roman date gave a typical C(3) terrestrial signal (average δ(13) C = -19.8‰, δ(15) N = 9.3‰), but also revealed one (SK12671) with a diet which included a substantial C(4) component (δ(13) C = -15.2‰, δ(15) N = 11.2‰). This is only the second such diet reported in Roman Britain. Subsequent δ(18) O(c) and (87) Sr/(86) Sr measurements on the dental enamel in this individual were, however, consistent with a \"local\" origin, indicating that either C(4) protein was consumed in Late Roman Britain, or that he came from somewhere else, but where conditions gave rise to similar isotopic values. If we accept the latter, then it indicates that using oxygen and strontium isotopes alone to identify \"incomers\" may be problematic. The provision of hobnailed boots for the dead appears to have had a strong symbolic element in Late Roman Britain. We suggest that in this case the boots may be significant, in that he was being equipped for the long march home.',\n",
              "  'Identification of botulinum toxin type in clinical samples and foods in Iran. BACKGROUND: Botulism is a serious neuroparalytic disease caused by toxins of Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin is produced under anaerobic conditions and is one of the most dangerous toxin in the world. Rapid diagnosis of botulism is very essential for successful therapy. In this study, we reviewed data of cases of botulism in Iran from April 2004 through March 2010. MATHERIALS AND METHODS: From a total of 1140 samples of suspected botulism samples, 477 serum, 294 stool, 111 gastric secretions, and 258 food samples were collected from 21 provinces. These samples belonged to 432 distinct patients. All samples were tested for botulism by mouse bioassay, a gold standard method for detection of botulism. RESULTS: From 1140 received samples, 64 (5.6 %) positive samples of botulism were identified. Of these, 14 (21.8 %) cases had toxin type A, seven (11 %) cases had toxin type B, 22 (34.3 %) cases had toxin type E, and seven (11 %) cases had toxin type AB. The toxin type could not been identified in 14 (21.8 %) cases. The highest positive results were in Gilan, Tehran, Golestan, and Hamedan provinces. Seafoods and locally- made cheese were the most implicated foods in type E and type A botulism, respectively. CONCLUSION: Accurate and rapid diagnosis of botulism is very important because every case of botulism can be a public health emergency. During the study period, the median number of positive cases per year was 2.7 (range: one to18). Therefore, it is suggested that all clinicians are required to submit the collected samples from patients with botulism symptoms to the botulism reference laboratory for specific diagnosis and confirmation of botulism.',\n",
              "  'Tumor suppressor SMAR1 activates and stabilizes p53 through its arginine-serine-rich motif. Various stresses and DNA-damaging agents trigger transcriptional activity of p53 by post-translational modifications, making it a global regulatory switch that controls cell proliferation and apoptosis. Earlier we have shown that the novel MAR-associated protein SMAR1 interacts with p53. Here we delineate the minimal domain of SMAR1 (the arginine-serine-rich domain) that is phosphorylated by protein kinase C family proteins and is responsible for p53 interaction, activation, and stabilization within the nucleus. SMAR1-mediated stabilization of p53 is brought about by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. We also demonstrate that this arginine-serine (RS)-rich domain triggers the various cell cycle modulating proteins that decide cell fate. Furthermore, phenotypic knock-down experiments using small interfering RNA showed that SMAR1 is required for activation and nuclear retention of p53. The level of phosphorylated p53 was significantly increased in the thymus of SMAR1 transgenic mice, showing in vivo significance of SMAR1 expression. This is the first report that demonstrates the mechanism of action of the MAR-binding protein SMAR1 in modulating the activity of p53, often referred to as the \"guardian of the genome.\"',\n",
              "  'New Agents for Acute Treatment of Migraine: CGRP Receptor Antagonists, iNOS Inhibitors. The treatment of migraine was advanced dramatically with the introduction of triptans in the early 1990s. Despite the substantial improvement in the quality of life that triptans have brought to many migraineurs, a substantial cohort of patients remain highly disabled by attacks and need new therapeutic approaches, which ideally should be quick-acting, have no vasoconstrictor activity, and have a longer duration of action and be better tolerated than current therapies. The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (gepants)-olcegepant (BIBN 4096 BS), telcagepant (MK-0974), MK3207, and BI 44370 TA-are effective in treating acute migraine. They have no vasoconstrictive properties, fewer adverse effects, and may act longer than triptans. Their development has been complicated by liver toxicity issues when used as preventives. Results from studies with BI 44370 TA do not support broad concern about a class effect, and further studies are ongoing in this respect. Many experimental studies and clinical trials suggest that nitric oxide may have a role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Therefore, the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for the acute or prophylactic treatment of migraine offered a feasible approach; as inducible NOS (iNOS) is involved in several pain states, such as inflammatory pain, it appeared to be an attractive target. However, despite high selectivity and potency, the iNOS inhibitor GW274150 was not effective for acute treatment or prophylaxis of migraine, suggesting that iNOS is very unlikely to be a promising target.',\n",
              "  \"[Wilson's disease]. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder leading to accumulation of copper in tissues, mainly in the liver and brain. Genetic defect is in the gene coding ATPase type P (ATP7B). The inheritance is autosomal recessive. Up to now, more then 500 mutations causing Wilson's disease were described. The most frequent mutation in Central Europe is mutation H1069Q. The manifestation of Wilson's disease is usually hepatic or neurologic. Hepatic form is manifested by acute or chronic hepatitis, steatosis or cirrhosis. Neurologic involvement is manifested usually after 20 year of age by motor disturbances (tremor, disturbed speech, problems with writing), which could progress into severe extrapyramidal syndrome with tremor, rigidity, dysartria, dysfagia and muscle contracture. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory examinations (neurologic symptoms, liver disease, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated free copper concentration in serum, high urine copper excretion, and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings). Confirmation of diagnosis is done by hepatic copper concentration in liver biopsy or by genetic examination. Untreated disease leads to the death of a patient. Treatment is based on chelating agents decreasing the copper content by excretion into urine (D-penicillamine, trientine) or on agents preventing absorption of copper from food (zinc, ammonium-tetrahiomolybdene). Patients with asymptomatic Wilson's disease have to be treated as well. In Czech Republic either penicillamine or zinc are used. Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with fulminant liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. Screening in families of affected patients (all siblings) is obvious.\",\n",
              "  \"Rapid and transient recruitment of DNMT1 to DNA double-strand breaks is mediated by its interaction with multiple components of the DNA damage response machinery. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark critical for regulating transcription, chromatin structure and genome stability. Although many studies have shed light on how methylation impacts transcription and interfaces with the histone code, far less is known about how it regulates genome stability. We and others have shown that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, contributes to the cellular response to DNA damage, yet DNMT1's exact role in this process remains unclear. DNA damage, particularly in the form of double-strand breaks (DSBs), poses a major threat to genome integrity. Cells therefore possess a potent system to respond to and repair DSBs, or to initiate cell death. In the current study, we used a near-infrared laser microirradiation system to directly study the link between DNMT1 and DSBs. Our results demonstrate that DNMT1 is rapidly but transiently recruited to DSBs. DNMT1 recruitment is dependent on its ability to interact with both PCNA and the ATR effector kinase CHK1, but is independent of its catalytic activity. In addition, we show for the first time that DNMT1 interacts with the 9-1-1 PCNA-like sliding clamp and that this interaction also contributes to DNMT1 localization to DNA DSBs. Finally, we demonstrate that DNMT1 modulates the rate of DSB repair and is essential for suppressing abnormal activation of the DNA damage response in the absence of exogenous damage. Taken together, our studies provide compelling additional evidence for DNMT1 acting as a regulator of genome integrity and as an early responder to DNA DSBs.\",\n",

FSHD is caused by deletion of a subset of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat units in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. In FSHD, the combination of inefficient chromatin silencing of the D4Z4 repeat and polymorphisms on the FSHD-permissive alleles that stabilize the DUX4 mRNAs emanating from the repeat result in inappropriate DUX4 protein expression in muscle cells. FSHD is thereby the first example of a human disease caused by the inefficient repression of a retrogene in a macrosatellite repeat array.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Chicken eggshell mineralization is a prominent model for biomineralization not only because of its importance for avian reproduction but also because of the commercial interest associated with eggshell quality. An analysis and comparison of the protein constituents of eggshells of several species would contribute to a better understanding of the shell mineralization process. The recent publication of the turkey genome sequence now provides a basis for the in-depth analysis of the turkey eggshell proteome. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis of turkey acid-soluble and acid-insoluble organic eggshell matrix yielded 697 identified proteins/protein groups. However, intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) results indicated that the 47 most abundant identified proteins already constituted 95% of the total turkey eggshell matrix proteome. Forty-four of these proteins were also identified in chicken eggshell matrix previously. Despite these similarities there were important and unexpected differences. While ovocleidin-116 and ovocalyxin-36 were major proteins constituting approximately 37% of the identified proteome, other members of the group of so-called eggshell-specific proteins were not identified. Thus ovocalyxin-21 and ovocalyxin-32 were missing among matrix proteins. Conversely, major turkey eggshell proteins were not detected in chicken, such as the bone protein periostin, the mammalian counterpart of which is involved in many aspects of bone metabolism and which represented 10-11% of the total identified proteome. CONCLUSIONS: Even members of the same avian family show important differences in eggshell matrix composition and more studies on the proteome and the transcriptome level will be necessary to identify a common toolkit of eggshell mineralization and to work out species differences among functional eggshell protein sets and their role in eggshell production.',\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compared with the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS), emergency physicians prospectively used the ROSIER as a stroke recognition tool on suspected patients in the prehospital setting. And, the final discharge diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack made by neurologists, after assessment and review of clinical symptomatology and brain imaging findings, was used as the reference standard for diagnosis in the study. Then, the ROSIER and the CPSS like sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), related coefficient (r) and Kappa value were calculated. RESULTS: In this study, 540 of 582 suspected stroke patients met the study criteria. The CPSS showed a diagnostic Se of 88.77% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 86.11-91.43%), Sp of 68.79% (95% CI 64.88-72.70%), PPV of 87.40% (95% CI 85.97-88.83%), NPV of 71.52% (95% CI 67.71-75.33%) and r of 0.503. Relatively, the ROSIER showed a diagnostic Se of 89.97% (95% CI 87.44-92.64%), Sp of 83.23% (95% CI 80.08-86.38%), PPV of 92.66% (95% CI 90.46-94.86%), NPV of 77.91% (95% CI 74.41-81.41%) and r of 0.584. According to the final discharge diagnosis, both the ROSIER and the CPSS were associated with the final discharge diagnosis (P < 0.05).The Kappa statistic value of the ROSIER and the CPSS were 0.718 and 0.582, respectively. However, there was no statistical significance of the positive rate between the ROSIER and the CPSS in this study (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The ROSIER is a sensitive and specific stroke recognition tool for health providers' use among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. However, it cannot be used to confidently rule out or identify stroke as a diagnosis. Comprehensive clinical assessment and further examination on potential stroke patients are still important and cannot be replaced. When it is difficult to objectively complete the ROSIER for patients, the CPSS could replace it in the prehospital setting.\",\n",

EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acute coronary syndromes is yet to be defined based on clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currently, there are no specific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants. The availability of an effective reversal agent would be very attractive for the management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or the need for emergent surgery.',\n",
              "  \"Imatinib mesylate for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the first human malignancy for which the promise of targeted therapy has come true. CML is invariably associated with a specific genetic lesion--the t(9;22) chromosomal translocation. As a consequence of this translocation, a BCR-ABL fusion gene is formed on the 22q- derivative (traditionally known as the Philadelphia chromosome) and the deregulated tyrosine kinase activity of the protein encoded by this gene has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for initiation and maintenance of the disease. Imatinib mesylate, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets Bcr-Abl, entered clinical evaluation in 1998. Its efficacy surpassed almost everyone's predictions, and the observation of high response rates and favorable toxicity profile associated with imatinib therapy led to its approval as first-line treatment for all newly diagnosed CML patients over an exceptionally short period of time. The 6-year results of the Phase III trial have recently been reported and confirm durability of responses and declining incidence of adverse events over time, although, at present, occurrence of unexpected side effects in the long term cannot be excluded. Although imatinib does not 'cure' CML and has to be administered chronically to patients, it has revolutionized both outcome and quality of life of CML patients.\",\n",
              "  'TYK2 activity promotes ligand-induced IFNAR1 proteolysis. The type I IFNR (interferon receptor) is a heterodimer composed of two transmembrane chains, IFNAR1 (interferon-alpha receptor 1 subunit) and IFNAR2, which are associated with the tyrosine kinases Tyk2 and Jak1 (Janus kinase 1) respectively. Ligand-induced down-regulation of the type I IFNR is a major mechanism of negative regulation of cellular signalling and involves the internalization and lysosomal degradation of IFNAR1. IFNalpha promotes the phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on Ser535, followed by recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, beta-TrCP2 (beta-transducin repeats-containing protein 2), ubiquitination of IFNAR1 and proteolysis. The non-catalytic role of Tyk2 in sustaining the steady-state IFNAR1 level at the plasma membrane is well documented; however, little is known about the function of Tyk2 in the steps that precede and succeed serine phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IFNAR1 in response to ligand binding. In the present study, we show that catalytic activation of Tyk2 is not essential for IFNAR1 internalization, but is required for ligand-induced IFNAR1 serine phosphorylation, ubiquitination and efficient lysosomal proteolysis.',\n",
              "  'Telomerase antagonist imetelstat inhibits esophageal cancer cell growth and increases radiation-induced DNA breaks. Telomerase is mainly active in human tumor cells, which provides an opportunity for a therapeutic window on telomerase targeting. We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1 week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed. Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths. Short-term imetelstat treatment also increased γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci staining in the esophageal cancer cell lines indicating a possible induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). We also found that pre-treatment with imetelstat led to increased number and size of 53BP1 foci after ionizing radiation. The increase of 53BP1 foci number was especially pronounced during the first 1h of repair whereas the increase of foci size was prominent later on. This study supports the potential of imetelstat as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of esophageal cancer.',\n",
              "  'Rindopepimut, a 14-mer injectable peptide vaccine against EGFRvIII for the potential treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. Celldex Therapeutics is developing rindopepimut (CDX-110), a 14-mer injectable peptide vaccine for the potential treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Rindopepimut specifically targets a novel junctional epitope of the EGFR deletion mutant EGFRvIII, which is a constitutively active receptor that is expressed in approximately 60 to 70% of patients with GBM. EGFRvIII expression is correlated with worse prognosis and reduced overall survival. Importantly, EGFRvIII is not expressed in normal brain tissue, making it an excellent therapeutic target. Preclinical studies demonstrated lasting tumor regression and increased survival times, as well as efficient generation of EGFRvIII-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, in animals expressing EGFRvIII and vaccinated with rindopepimut. Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with GBM demonstrated significantly increased median time to progression and overall survival time in those vaccinated with rindopepimut compared with matched historical controls. Only limited side effects have been observed in patients. Given these results, rindopepimut is an extremely promising therapy for patients with GBM. Phase I and II clinical trials in patients with GBM were ongoing at the time of publication. In the future, it may be beneficial to combine rindopepimut with other treatment modalities to further prolong survival.',\n",

              "  'Sinodielide A exerts thermosensitizing effects and induces apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest in DU145 human prostate cancer cells via the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Sinodielide A (SA) is a naturally occurring guaianolide, which is isolated from the root of Sinodielsia yunnanensis. This root, commonly found in Yunnan province, is used in traditional Chinese medicine as an antipyretic, analgesic and diaphoretic agent. A number of studies have reported that agents isolated from a species of Umbelliferae (Apiaceae) have antitumor activities. We previously reported, using combined treatments with this medicinal herb and hyperthermia at various temperatures, an enhanced cytotoxicity in the human prostate cancer androgen - independent cell lines, PC3 and DU145, and analyzed the related mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the effects of treatment with SA prior to hyperthermia on the thermosensitivity of DU145 cells, and the mechanisms related to the induction of apoptosis and G(2)/M cell cycle arrest via the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, as well as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. Cells were exposed to hyperthermia alone (40-44˚C) or hyperthermia in combination with SA. Lethal damage to cells treated with mild hyperthermia (40 or 42˚C) for up to 6 h was slight; however, hyperthermia in combination with SA synergistically enhanced thermosensivity. Lethal damage to cells treated with acute hyperthermia (43 or 44˚C) was more severe, but these effects were also enhanced and were more significant by the combined treatment with SA. The kinetics of apoptosis induction and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, the levels of ERK1/2, JNK and Akt were determined by western blot analysis. The incidence of apoptotic cells after treatment with SA (20.0 µM) at 37˚C for 4 h, hyperthermia (44˚C) alone for 30 min, and the combination in sequence were examined. The sub-G1 division (%) in the diagram obtained by flow cytometry was applied to that assay. The percentage of apoptotic cells (10.53±5.02%) was higher at 48 h as compared to 0, 12 and 24 h after treatment. The distribution of DU145 cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase was markedly increased after 24 h of heating at 44˚C and after the combined treatment with heating and SA. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced following treatment with heating and SA, while the levels of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) were markedly increased immediately after heating at 44˚C and when heating was combined with SA. By contrast, the levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) were immediately increased only after heating at 44˚C. Thus, we concluded that SA exerts its thermosensitizing effects on DU145 cells by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.',\n",
              "  \"Drug development based on the metals hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease. The recent report of positive results from a Phase IIa clinical trial of PBT2, a novel drug that targets amyloid-beta-metal interactions, underscores the value of abnormal transition metal metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. The Metals Hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease is based upon observations of the precipitation of amyloid-beta by zinc and its radicalization by copper. Both metals are markedly enriched in plaques. The Hypothesis involves the perturbance of these endogenous brain metals, and it does not consider toxicological exposure part of pathogenesis. Recent descriptions of the release of ionic zinc and copper in the cortical glutamatergic synapse, modulating the response of the NMDA receptor, may explain the vulnerability of amyloid-beta to abnormal interaction with these metal ions in the synaptic region leading to aggregation and fostering toxicity. Increasingly sophisticated medicinal chemistry approaches are being tested which correct the abnormalities without causing systemic disturbance of these essential minerals. PBT2, clioquinol and related compounds are ionophores rather than chelators. PBT2 is a once per day, orally bioavailable, second generation 8-OH quinoline derivative of clioquinol. It has performed very satisfactorily in toxicology and Phase I clinical trials and is advancing as a disease-modifying candidate drug for Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",
              "  'Expression of DeltaNp73 is a molecular marker for adverse outcome in neuroblastoma patients. The p73 gene is a p53 homologue which induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation. Although p73 maps at 1p36.3 and is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma (NB), it does not act as a classic oncosuppressor gene. In developing sympathetic neurons of mice, p73 is predominantly expressed as a truncated anti-apoptotic isoform (DeltaNp73), which antagonizes both p53 and the full-length p73 protein (TAp73). This suggests that p73 may be part of a complex tumor-control mechanism. To determine the role of DeltaNp73 in NB we analyzed the pattern of expression of this gene in vivo and evaluated the prognostic significance of its expression. Our results indicate that DeltaNp73 expression is associated with reduced apoptosis in a NB tumor tissue. Expression of this variant in NB patients significantly correlates with age at diagnosis and VMA urinary excretion. Moreover it is strongly associated with reduced survival (HR=7.93; P<0.001) and progression-free survival (HR=5.3; P<0.001) and its role in predicting a poorer outcome is independent from age, primary tumor site, stage and MYCN amplification (OS: HR=5.24, P=0.012; PFS: HR=4.36, P=0.005). In conclusion our data seem to indicate that DeltaNp73 is a crucial gene in neuroblastoma pathogenesis.',\n",
              "  'Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation. Maintenance of genomic methylation patterns is mediated primarily by DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). We have solved structures of mouse and human DNMT1 composed of CXXC, tandem bromo-adjacent homology (BAH1/2), and methyltransferase domains bound to DNA-containing unmethylated CpG sites. The CXXC specifically binds to unmethylated CpG dinucleotide and positions the CXXC-BAH1 linker between the DNA and the active site of DNMT1, preventing de novo methylation. In addition, a loop projecting from BAH2 interacts with the target recognition domain (TRD) of the methyltransferase, stabilizing the TRD in a retracted position and preventing it from inserting into the DNA major groove. Our studies identify an autoinhibitory mechanism, in which unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are occluded from the active site to ensure that only hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides undergo methylation.',\n",
              "  'Partially functional Cenpa-GFP fusion protein causes increased chromosome missegregation and apoptosis during mouse embryogenesis. CENP-A is an essential histone H3-like protein that localizes to the centromeric region of eukaryotic chromosomes. Heterozygous and homozygous Cenpa-GFP fusion-protein mouse mutants, generated through targeted insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene into the mouse Cenpa gene locus, show specific localized fluorescence at all the centromeres. Heterozygous mice are healthy and fertile. Cenpa-GFP homozygotes (Cenpag/g) undergo many cell divisions, giving rise to up to one million cells that show relatively accurate differentiation into distinct mouse embryonic tissues until day 10.5 when significant levels of chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and apoptosis result in death. Cenpag/g embryos assemble functional kinetochores that bind to a host of centromere-specific structural and mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins (Cenpc, BubR1, Mad2 and Zw10). Examination of the nucleosomal phasing of centromeric minor and pericentromeric major satellite sequences indicates that the formation of Cenpag/g homotypic nucleosomes is not accompanied by any overt alteration to the overall size of the monomeric nucleosomal structure or the spacing of these structures. This study provides the first example of an essential centromeric protein gene variant in which subtle perturbation at the centromeric nucleosomal/chromatin level manifests in a significantly delayed lethality when compared with Cenpa null mice.',\n",
              "  '3,5-dimethylisoxazoles act as acetyl-lysine-mimetic bromodomain ligands. Histone-lysine acetylation is a vital chromatin post-translational modification involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Bromodomains bind acetylated lysines, acting as readers of the histone-acetylation code. Competitive inhibitors of this interaction have antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. With 57 distinct bromodomains known, the discovery of subtype-selective inhibitors of the histone-bromodomain interaction is of great importance. We have identified the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety as a novel acetyl-lysine bioisostere, which displaces acetylated histone-mimicking peptides from bromodomains. Using X-ray crystallographic analysis, we have determined the interactions responsible for the activity and selectivity of 4-substituted 3,5-dimethylisoxazoles against a selection of phylogenetically diverse bromodomains. By exploiting these interactions, we have developed compound 4d, which has IC(50) values of <5 μM for the bromodomain-containing proteins BRD2(1) and BRD4(1). These compounds are promising leads for the further development of selective probes for the bromodomain and extra C-terminal domain (BET) family and CREBBP bromodomains.',\n",

The ficolins and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) are collagen-like defence proteins that serve as recognition molecules in lectin complement pathway. Differential features that may indicate diverse functions of these proteins are poorly understood. In this study we compared important biological features of the ficolins and MBL. We investigated the tissue distribution of the FCN1-3 and the MBL2 genes encoding the ficolins and MBL by quantitative PCR. Recombinant proteins were produced and structural and biological characteristics were investigated and compared. Our main findings were that FCN3 mRNA was highly expressed in the liver and lung compared with the other genes revealing the lung as the tissue with the highest FCN3 expression pattern. Ficolin-3 revealed higher complement activating capacity compared with Ficolin-2, MBL and Ficolin-1 and was highly resistant to bacterial collagenase treatment, which is different from the other ficolins and MBL. We discovered several unique properties of Ficolin-3 showing that FCN3 is the most highly expressed gene in liver and lung among the lectin complement pathway initiators. Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators.',\n",
              "  'Can the FAST and ROSIER adult stroke recognition tools be applied to confirmed childhood arterial ischemic stroke? BACKGROUND: Stroke recognition tools have been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy in adults. Development of a similar tool in children is needed to reduce lag time to diagnosis. A critical first step is to determine whether adult stoke scales can be applied in childhood stroke.Our objective was to assess the applicability of adult stroke scales in childhood arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) METHODS: Children aged 1 month to < 18 years with radiologically confirmed acute AIS who presented to a tertiary emergency department (ED) (2003 to 2008) were identified retrospectively. Signs, symptoms, risk factors and initial management were extracted. Two adult stroke recognition tools; ROSIER (Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room) and FAST (Face Arm Speech Test) scales were applied retrospectively to all patients to determine test sensitivity. RESULTS: 47 children with AIS were identified. 34 had anterior, 12 had posterior and 1 child had anterior and posterior circulation infarcts. Median age was 9 years and 51% were male. Median time from symptom onset to ED presentation was 21 hours but one third of children presented within 6 hours. The most common presenting stroke symptoms were arm (63%), face (62%), leg weakness (57%), speech disturbance (46%) and headache (46%). The most common signs were arm (61%), face (70%) or leg weakness (57%) and dysarthria (34%). 36 (78%) of children had at least one positive variable on FAST and 38 (81%) had a positive score of > 1 on the ROSIER scale. Positive scores were less likely in children with posterior circulation stroke. CONCLUSION: The presenting features of pediatric stroke appear similar to adult strokes. Two adult stroke recognition tools have fair to good sensitivity in radiologically confirmed childhood AIS but require further development and modification. Specificity of the tools also needs to be determined in a prospective cohort of children with stroke and non-stroke brain attacks.',\n",

              "  'Chromosome XII context is important for rDNA function in yeast. The rDNA cluster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is located 450 kb from the left end and 610 kb from the right end of chromosome XII and consists of approximately 150 tandemly repeated copies of a 9.1 kb rDNA unit. To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number. The frequency of silencing of URA3 inserted within the rDNA locus was found to be greater than in a wild-type strain. The localization and morphology of the nucleolus was also affected such that a single and occasionally (6-12% frequency) two foci for Nop1p and a rounded nucleolus were observed, whereas a typical crescent-shaped nucleolar structure was seen in the wild-type strain. Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spans than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles. These observations suggest that the context of chromosome XII plays an important role in maintaining a constant rDNA copy number and in physiological processes related to rDNA function in S.cerevisiae.',\n",
              "  'Nf1;Trp53 mutant mice develop glioblastoma with evidence of strain-specific effects. Astrocytomas are the leading cause of brain cancer in humans. Because these tumours are highly infiltrative, current treatments that rely on targeting the tumour mass are often ineffective. A mouse model for astrocytoma would be a powerful tool for dissecting tumour progression and testing therapeutics. Mouse models of astrocytoma have been designed to express oncogenic proteins in astrocytes, but have had limited success due to low tumour penetrance or limited tumour progression. We present here a mouse model of astrocytomas involving mutation of two tumour-suppressor genes, Nf1 and Trp53. Humans with mutations in NF1 develop neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and have increased risk of optic gliomas, astrocytomas and glioblastomas. The TP53 tumour suppressor is often mutated in a subset of astrocytomas that develop at a young age and progress slowly to glioblastoma (termed secondary glioblastomas, in contrast to primary glioblastomas that develop rapidly de novo). This mouse model shows a range of astrocytoma stages, from low-grade astrocytoma to glioblastoma multiforme, and may accurately model human secondary glioblastoma involving TP53 loss. This is the first reported mouse model of astrocytoma initiated by loss of tumour suppressors, rather than overexpression of transgenic oncogenes.',\n",
              "  'Analysis of the intracellular localization of p73 N-terminal protein isoforms TAp73 and ∆Np73 in medulloblastoma cell lines. The protein homologous to the tumor suppressor p53, p73, has essential roles in development and tumorigenesis. This protein exists in a wide range of isoforms with different, even antagonistic, functions. However, there are virtually no detailed morphological studies analyzing the endogenous expression of p73 isoforms at the cellular level in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the expression and subcellular distribution of two N-terminal isoforms, TAp73 and ΔNp73, in medulloblastoma cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. Both proteins were observed in all cell lines examined, but differences were noted in their intracellular localization between the reference Daoy cell line and four newly established medulloblastoma cell lines (MBL-03, MBL-06, MBL-07 and MBL-10). In the new cell lines, TAp73 and ΔNp73 were located predominantly in cell nuclei. However, there was heterogeneity in TAp73 distribution in the cells of all MBL cell lines, with the protein located in the nucleus and also in a limited non-random area in the cytoplasm. In a small percentage of cells, we detected cytoplasmic localization of TAp73 only, i.e., nuclear exclusion was observed. Our results provide a basis for future studies on the causes and function of distinct intracellular localization of p73 protein isoforms with respect to different protein-protein interactions in medulloblastoma cells.',\n",

UNLABELLED: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) accounts for 15-20% of adult leukemias but is very rare in children (2%). Fewer than 10% of CML patients are younger than 20 years. CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome or the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. The objective of this paper is to present the monitoring of imatinib therapy in two children with CML by the BCR-ABL fusion gene expression assessment from peripheral blood with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 18 and six months follow-up of the patients included clinical examination, routine laboratory tests, bone marrow aspirate investigation including cytogenetic tests and the major BCR-ABL fusion gene expression measurement with qRT-PCR method from the peripheral blood. RESULTS: Patient No. 1 diagnosed with chronic phase CML showed excellent adherence to daily 400 mg imatinib treatment and achieved complete hematologic (CHR) and cytogenetic response (CCR) by three months and major molecular response (MMR) by 12 months, with lack of side effects due to imatinib. Patient No. 2 experienced severe hematologic toxicity, which necessitated temporary withdrawal of the drug. Transient non-compliance together with imatinib dose reduction has driven to treatment failure. In this case, mutational analysis is warranted. CONCLUSIONS: BCR-ABL fusion gene expression level measurement from peripheral blood with qRT-PCR method is an excellent tool in the follow-up of CML patients.',\n",

              "  'Subcellular localization and signaling properties of dishevelled in developing vertebrate embryos. The Dishevelled protein mediates several diverse biological processes. Intriguingly, within the same tissues where Xenopus Dishevelled (Xdsh) controls cell fate via canonical Wnt signaling, it also controls cell polarity via the vertebrate planar cell polarity (PCP) cascade [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9]. The relationship between subcellular localization of Dishevelled and its signaling activities remains unclear; conflicting results have been reported depending upon the organism and cell types examined [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20]. We have approached this issue by developing new reagents to sequester wild-type Dishevelled protein either at the cell membrane or away from the cell membrane. Removal of Dishevelled from the cell membrane disrupts convergent extension by preventing Rho/Rac activation and mediolateral cell polarization. By manipulating the subcellular localization of K-->M (dsh1), we show that this mutation inhibits Dishevelled activation of Rac, regardless of its subcellular localization. These data demonstrate that membrane localization of Dishevelled is a prerequisite for vertebrate PCP signaling. However, both membrane-targeted and cytoplasm-targeted Dishevelled can potently activate canonical Wnt signaling, suggesting that local concentration of Dishevelled protein, but not its spatial localization, is central to canonical Wnt signaling. These results suggest that in vertebrate embryos, subcellular localization is insufficient to account for the pathway specificity of Dishevelled in the canonical Wnt versus PCP signaling cascades.',\n",
              "  \"Neonatal diabetes, gallbladder agenesis, duodenal atresia, and intestinal malrotation caused by a novel homozygous mutation in RFX6. Recently, bi-allelic mutations in the transcription factor RFX6 were described as the cause of a rare condition characterized by neonatal diabetes with pancreatic and biliary hypoplasia and duodenal/jejunal atresia. A male infant developed severe hyperglycemia (446 mg/dL) within 24 h of birth. Acute abdominal concerns by day five necessitated exploratory surgery that revealed duodenal atresia, gallbladder agenesis, annular pancreas and intestinal malrotation. He also exhibited chronic diarrhea and feeding intolerance, cholestatic jaundice, and subsequent liver failure. He died of sepsis at four months old while awaiting liver transplantation. The phenotype of neonatal diabetes with intestinal atresia and biliary agenesis clearly pointed to RFX6 as the causative gene; indeed, whole exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous RFX6 mutation c.779A>C; p.Lys260Thr (K260T). This missense mutation also changes the consensus 5' splice donor site before intron 7 and is thus predicted to cause disruption in splicing. Both parents, who were not known to be related, were heterozygous carriers. Targeted genetic testing based on consideration of phenotypic features may reveal a cause among the many genes now associated with heterogeneous forms of monogenic neonatal diabetes. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using modern sequencing technology to identify one such rare cause. Continued research is needed to determine the possible cost-effectiveness of this approach, especially when clear phenotypic clues are absent. Further study of patients with RFX6 mutations should clarify its role in pancreatic, intestinal and enteroendocrine cellular development and explain features such as the diarrhea exhibited in our case.\",\n",

We investigated the expression of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) and the functional role of NCX in retinal damage by using NCX1-heterozygous deficient mice (NCX1(+/-)) and SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy] phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline), a selective NCX inhibitor in vivo. We also examined the role of NCX in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stress with a retinal ganglion cell line (RGC-5) cell culture in vitro. The expression of NCX1 was confirmed and entirely localized in retina by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. NCX1(+/-) mice possessed significant protection against retinal damage induced by intravitreal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). SEA0400 at 3 and 10 mg/kg significantly reduced NMDA- or high intraocular pressure-induced retinal cell damage in mice. Furthermore, SEA0400 reduced the number of TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling)-positive cells and the expression of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2, JNK, p38) induced by NMDA injection. In RGC-5, SEA0400 at 0.3 and 1 microM significantly inhibited OGD-induced cell damage. OGD-induced cell damage was aggravated by ouabain (a Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) at 100 microM, and this increased damage was significantly reduced by SEA0400 at 1 microM.

PURPOSE: Imatinib induces a durable response in most patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, but it is currently unclear whether imatinib reduces the leukemic stem cell (LSC) burden, which may be an important step toward enabling safe discontinuation of therapy. In this article, we use mathematical models of BCR-ABL levels to make inferences on the dynamics of LSCs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with at least 1 BCR-ABL transcript measurement on imatinib were included (N = 477). Maximum likelihood methods were used to test 3 potential hypotheses of the dynamics of BCR-ABL transcripts on imatinib therapy: (i) monoexponential, in which there is little, if any, decline in BCR-ABL transcripts; (ii) biexponential, in which patients have a rapid initial decrease in BCR-ABL transcripts followed by a more gradual response; and (iii) triexponential, in which patients first exhibit a biphasic decline but then have a third phase when BCR-ABL transcripts increase rapidly. RESULTS: We found that most patients treated with imatinib exhibit a biphasic decrease in BCR-ABL transcript levels, with a rapid decrease during the first few months of treatment, followed by a more gradual decrease that often continues over many years. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the only hypothesis consistent with current data on progenitor cell turnover and with the long-term, gradual decrease in the BCR-ABL levels seen in most patients is that these patients exhibit a continual, gradual reduction of the LSCs. This observation may explain the ability to discontinue imatinib therapy without relapse in some cases.',\n",
              "  'McLeod phenotype without the McLeod syndrome. BACKGROUND: McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is a late-onset X-linked multisystem disorder affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems, red blood cells (RBCs), and internal organs. A variety of mutations have been found in the responsible gene (XK) including single nonsense and missense mutations, nucleotide mutations at or near the splice junctions of introns of XK, and different deletion mutations. To date no clear phenotype-genotype correlation is apparent. The clinical details of one case of McLeod phenotype without apparent neuromuscular abnormalities have been reported. Here the clinical details of two additional cases are presented, of which the genetic details have previously been published. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases at ages expected to manifest the McLeod syndrome (MLS) were evaluated. The first case had been authenticated as a genuine McLeod both by serology and by genotyping (R222G missense mutation) and the second case had a mutation in XK (IVS2+5G>A) and by serology exhibited very weak Kx antigen and no detectable Kell antigens, except extremely low k antigen by adsorption-elution technique. The patients were examined for hematologic, neurologic, and other clinical abnormalities. RESULTS: Despite documented McLeod phenotype on RBCs, and identified mutations of XK, neurologic and other clinical findings were minimal at ages expected to manifest MLS. CONCLUSIONS: The different XK mutations may have different effects upon the XK gene product and thus may account for the variable phenotype.',\n",
              "  'Inhibition of RANKL as a treatment for osteoporosis: preclinical and early clinical studies. Osteoporosis and several other bone disorders occur when there is an imbalance between the resorption and formation components of bone remodeling activity. Therapies available for some of these conditions modulate the activity of osteoclasts and/or osteoblasts. The recent discoveries of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), an endogenous activator of osteoclastogenenesis and osteoclast activity and its inhibitor, osteoprotegerin (OPG) as pivotal regulatory factors in the pathogenesis of bone diseases like osteoporosis provide unique targets for therapeutic agents. In laboratory animals and now in humans, administering forms of OPG markedly inhibits osteoclast activity and improves bone strength, documenting that the strategy of inhibiting RANKL activity has therapeutic promise. A highly specific, fully human antibody against RANKL has been produced (denosumab) that in early studies in humans reduces bone turnover and improves bone density. Attributes of denosumab in these clinical studies include a very rapid onset of action, sustained effects for several months after a single injection, and good tolerability. These results provide the basis for studies evaluating the effectiveness of denosumab in several clinical conditions characterized by increased osteoclastic activity.',\n",
              "  'Alteration of POLDIP3 splicing associated with loss of function of TDP-43 in tissues affected with ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by selective loss of motor neurons. In the ALS motor neurons, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is dislocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm and forms inclusions, suggesting that loss of a nuclear function of TDP-43 may underlie the pathogenesis of ALS. TDP-43 functions in RNA metabolism include regulation of transcription, mRNA stability, and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. However, a function of TDP-43 in tissue affected with ALS has not been elucidated. We sought to identify the molecular indicators reflecting on a TDP-43 function. Using exon array analysis, we observed a remarkable alteration of splicing in the polymerase delta interacting protein 3 (POLDIP3) as a result of the depletion of TDP-43 expression in two types of cultured cells. In the cells treated with TDP-43 siRNA, wild-type POLDIP3 (variant-1) decreased and POLDIP3 lacking exon 3 (variant-2) increased. The RNA binding ability of TDP-43 was necessary for inclusion of POLDIP3 exon 3. Moreover, we found an increment of POLDIP3 variant-2 mRNA in motor cortex, spinal cord and spinal motor neurons collected by laser capture microdissection with ALS. Our results suggest a loss of TDP-43 function in tissues affected with ALS, supporting the hypothesis that a loss of function of TDP-43 underlies the pathogenesis of ALS.',\n",
              "  'From the circumsporozoite protein to the RTS, S/AS candidate vaccine. The RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria vaccine candidate has recently entered Phase 3 testing. Reaching this important milestone is the culmination of more than 20 years of research and development by GlaxoSmithKline and partners and collaborators. The vaccine has been developed to protect young children and infants living in Sub-Saharan Africa against clinical and severe disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection. Over the past 9 years, RTS,S/AS has been evaluated in multiple Phase 2 studies. The vaccine was shown to have a favorable safety profile and to be well tolerated in all age groups in which it was tested, including the intended target population of infants and young children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Data obtained so far suggest that RTS,S/AS can be co-administered with other vaccines included in the routine Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI). In Phase 2 testing, the vaccine candidate was shown to confer significant protection against P. falciparum infection and clinical disease, including severe malaria. Furthermore, a trend towards an indirect beneficial effect of the vaccine on non-malarial morbidities has been observed in several trials. In this paper, we will describe the genesis of the RTS,S/AS concept, including the rationale for selecting the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) as the target antigen. Early development history of the vaccine will be briefly described. We will present the most salient results from recent Phase 2 studies conducted in the target pediatric population, which have led to the decision to progress RTS,S/AS to Phase 3 testing. If the Phase 3 results confirm the observations made during Phase 2 testing, the RTS,S/AS vaccine, when broadly implemented and judiciously integrated with other malaria-prevention measures, would have a major public-health impact in Sub-Saharan Africa.',\n",
              "  \"Nigral and cortical Lewy bodies and dystrophic nigral neurites in Parkinson's disease and cortical Lewy body disease contain alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. A mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene has recently been linked to some cases of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). We characterized the expression of this presynaptic protein in the midbrain, striatum, and temporal cortex of control, PD, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) brain. Control brain showed punctate pericellular immunostaining. PD brain demonstrated alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in nigral Lewy bodies, pale bodies and abnormal neurites. Rare neuronal soma in PD brain were immunoreactive for alpha-synuclein. DLB cases demonstrated these findings as well as alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in cortical Lewy bodies and CA2-3 neurites. These results suggest that, even in sporadic cases, there is an early and direct role for alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of PD and the neuropathologically related disorder DLB.\",\n",

              "  'Pregnancy, delivery, and outcome for the child in maternal epilepsy. PURPOSE: To investigate pregnancy, delivery, and child outcome in an unselected population of women with both treated and untreated epilepsy. METHODS: In the compulsory Medical Birth Registry of Norway, all 2,861 deliveries by women with epilepsy recorded from 1999-2005 were compared to all 369,267 nonepilepsy deliveries in the same period. RESULTS: The majority (66%, n = 1900) in the epilepsy group did not use antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy. A total of 961 epilepsy-pregnancies were exposed to AEDs. Compared to nonepilepsy controls, AED-exposed infants were more often preterm (p = 0.01), and more often had birth weight <2,500 g (p < 0.001), head circumference <2.5 percentile (p < 0.001), and low Apgar score (p = 0.03). Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (<10 percentile) occurred more frequently in both AED-exposed (p = 0.05) and unexposed (p = 0.02) epilepsy-pregnancies. Frequency of major congenital malformations (MCMs) was 2.8% (n = 81) in the epilepsy group versus 2.5% in controls (p = 0.3). Increased risk for MCMs could be demonstrated only for exposure to valproate (5.6%, p = 0.005) and AED polytherapy (6.1%, p = 0.02). Neonatal spina bifida was not significantly increased, but was a major indication for elective pregnancy termination among women with epilepsy. Cesarean section was performed more often in maternal epilepsy, regardless of AED-exposure (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Adverse pregnancy and birth outcome in women with epilepsy is mainly confined to AED-exposed pregnancies, although some risks are associated also with untreated epilepsy. The risk for congenital malformations was lower than previously reported. This could be due to a shift in AED selection, folic acid supplement, or possibly reflect the true risks in an unselected epilepsy population.',\n",
              "  \"Twiddler's syndrome in a patient with a deep brain stimulation device for generalized dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the technique of neurostimulation of deep brain structures for the treatment of conditions such as essential tremor, dystonia, Parkinson's disease and chronic pain syndromes. The procedure uses implanted deep brain stimulation electrodes connected to extension leads and an implantable pulse generator (IPG). Hardware failure related to the DBS procedure is not infrequent, and includes electrode migration and disconnection. We describe a patient who received bilateral globus pallidus internus DBS for dystonia with initially good clinical response, but the device eventually failed. Radiographs showed multiple twisting of the extension leads with disconnection from the brain electrodes and a diagnosis of Twiddler's syndrome was made. Twiddler's syndrome was first described in patients with cardiac pacemakers. Patients with mental disability, elderly and obese patients are at increased risk. Twiddler's syndrome should be suspected whenever there is a failure of the DBS device to relieve symptoms previously responsive to stimulation. Surgical correction is usually required.\",\n",

Lack of specific antidotes is a major concern in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) related to direct anticoagulants including dabigatran (OAC-ICH). We examined the efficacy of idarucizumab, an antibody fragment binding to dabigatran, in a mouse model of OAC-ICH. Dabigatran etexilate (DE) dose-dependently prolonged diluted thrombin time and tail-vein bleeding time, which were reversed by idarucizumab. Pretreatment with DE increased intracerebral hematoma volume and cerebral hemoglobin content. Idarucizumab in equimolar dose prevented excess hematoma expansion for both DE doses. In more extensive ICH, idarucizumab significantly reduced mortality. Thus, idarucizumab prevents excess intracerebral hematoma formation in mice anticoagulated with dabigatran and reduces mortality.',\n",
              "  \"Intravenous vs subcutaneous naloxone for out-of-hospital management of presumed opioid overdose. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether naloxone administered i.v. to out-of-hospital patients with suspected opioid overdose would have a more rapid therapeutic onset than naloxone given subcutaneously (s.q.). METHODS: A prospective, sequential, observational cohort study of 196 consecutive patients with suspected opioid overdose was conducted in an urban out-of-hospital setting, comparing time intervals from arrival at the patient's side to development of a respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min, and durations of bag-valve-mask ventilation. Subjects received either naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. (n = 74) or naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. (n = 122), for respiratory depression of <10 breaths/min. RESULTS: Mean interval from crew arrival to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min was 9.3 +/- 4.2 min for the i.v. group vs 9.6 +/- 4.58 min for the s.q. group (95% CI of the difference -1.55, 1.00). Mean duration of bag-valve-mask ventilation was 8.1 +/- 6.0 min for the i.v. group vs 9.1 +/- 4.8 min for the s.q. group. Cost of materials for administering naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. was $12.30/patient, compared with $10.70/patient for naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. CONCLUSION: There was no clinical difference in the time interval to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min between naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. and naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. for the out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected opioid overdose. The slower rate of absorption via the s.q. route was offset by the delay in establishing an i.v.\",\n",
              "  'The use of cffDNA in fetal sex determination during the first trimester of pregnancy of female DMD carriers. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis for fetal sex determination is generally the first step in the prenatal diagnosis of X-linked genetic disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, non-invasive prenatal diagnostic (NIPD) techniques such as measurement of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma are preferable given the procedure-related miscarriage rate of CVS. We determined fetal sex during the first trimester using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of cffDNA in pregnant carriers of DMD. The fetal sex was confirmed by amniocentesis karyotype analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) at 16 weeks. This procedure may avoid unnecessary CVS or amniocentesis of female fetuses.',\n",
              "  'Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of an anti-interleukin-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody (siltuximab) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. PURPOSE: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Siltuximab (CNTO 328) is a chimeric, murine-human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds human IL-6 with high affinity. C-reactive protein (CRP) can be a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker of IL-6 bioactivity. Reductions in CRP may correlate with clinical activity and IL-6 bioactivity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Starting-dose selection for this study was based on a previous siltuximab study in multiple myeloma patients. Pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD modeling explored the relationship between siltuximab PK and CRP suppression following i.v. siltuximab infusion in a three-part phase I/II study in 68 metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients. Modeling results were then used to simulate and determine which siltuximab dosage regimens would maintain CRP suppression below the lower limit of quantification (4 mg/L). Siltuximab was given at 1, 3, 6, or 12 mg/kg at weeks 1 and 4 and then every 2 weeks for 2 cycles in part 1; at 3 or 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in part 2; and at 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 6 cycles in part 3. RESULTS: A two-compartment PK model adequately described the serum siltuximab concentration-time data. An inhibitory indirect response PD model examined the relationship between siltuximab concentrations and CRP suppression. PD parameter estimates seemed reliable and physiologically relevant. Simulations showed that 6 mg/kg siltuximab every 2 weeks or 9 mg/kg every 3 weeks would reduce serum CRP to below 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Using a stepwise design, PK/PD modeling was used to select the dose levels in this study. Furthermore, PK/PD modeling results were used to help select doses to be used in future siltuximab clinical development.',\n",
              "  'Functional analysis of splicing mutations in exon 7 of NF1 gene. BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders, affecting about 1:3,500 individuals. NF1 exon 7 displays weakly defined exon-intron boundaries, and is particularly prone to missplicing. METHODS: In this study we investigated the expression of exon 7 transcripts using bioinformatic identification of splicing regulatory sequences, and functional minigene analysis of four sequence changes [c.910C>T (R304X), c.945G>A/c.946C>A (Q315Q/L316M), c.1005T>C (N335N)] identified in exon 7 of three different NF1 patients. RESULTS: Our results detected the presence of three exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and one putative exonic splicing silencer (ESS) element. The wild type minigene assay resulted in three alternative isoforms, including a transcript lacking NF1 exon 7 (NF1DeltaE7). Both the wild type and the mutated constructs shared NF1DeltaE7 in addition to the complete messenger, but displayed a different ratio between the two transcripts. In the presence of R304X and Q315Q/L316M mutations, the relative proportion between the different isoforms is shifted toward the expression of NF1DeltaE7, while in the presence of N335N variant, the NF1DeltaE7 expression is abolished. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it appears mandatory to investigate the role of each nucleotide change within the NF1 coding sequence, since a significant proportion of NF1 exon 7 mutations affects pre-mRNA splicing, by disrupting exonic splicing motifs and modifying the delicate balance between aberrantly and correctly spliced transcripts.',\n",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant disorder caused by deleterious mutations within the RET protooncogene. MEN2 RET mutations are mainly heterozygous, missense sequence changes found in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16. Our group has developed the publicly available, searchable MEN2 RET database to aid in genotype/phenotype correlations, using Human Genome Variation Society recommendations for sequence variation nomenclature and database content. The MEN2 RET database catalogs all RET sequence variation relevant to the MEN2 syndromes, with associated clinical information. Each database entry lists a RET sequence variation's location within the RET gene, genotype, pathogenicity classification, MEN2 phenotype, first literature reference, and comments (which may contain information on other clinical features, complex genotypes, and additional literature references). The MEN2 phenotype definitions were derived from the International RET Mutation Consortium guidelines for classification of MEN2 disease phenotypes. Although nearly all of the 132 RET sequence variation entries initially cataloged in the database were from literature reports, novel sequence variation and updated phenotypic information for any existing database entry can be submitted electronically on the database website. The database website also contains links to selected MEN2 literature reviews, gene and protein information, and RET reference sequences. The MEN2 RET database (www.arup.utah.edu/database/MEN2/MEN2_welcome.php) will serve as a repository for MEN2-associated RET sequence variation and reference for RET genotype/MEN2 phenotype correlations.\",\n",

UNLABELLED: Immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-RSD) is a new disease entity first proposed with regard to autoimmune pancreatitis. A 67-year-old male patient was examined because of weight loss and an abdominal pain. Based on the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters and ultrasound features, we identified the diagnosis of the IgG4-related systemic disease (IgG4-RSD), that was confirmed by the histopathological analysis after the biopsy of the head of pancreas. After confirmation, we started with the corticosteroid therapy with a good clinical, biochemical and morphological response. During the previous therapy, the disturbance of glucoregulation appeared, so we had to change the modality of treatment. We decided to add Azathioprine to the therapy in a dose of 150 mg/day. We achieved a stable phase of the disease with IgG 4.37 g/l and IgG4 0.179 g/l, and with no side effects from the therapy. LEARNING POINTS: There are potential clinical applications of identifying subsets of patients with IgG4 thyroiditis (FVHT and Riedel thyroiditis).A trial of immunosuppressive therapy should be included if a resection is deemed inadvisable.In particular, cases of FVHT that mimic malignancy, tissue and serum IgG4 may provide supportive diagnostic information.',\n",

Anticoagulation is recommended for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and/or arterial thromboembolism. The therapeutic arsenal of anticoagulants available to clinicians is mainly composed by unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux and oral vitamin K antagonists (VKA) (i.e. warfarin and acenocumarol). These anticoagulants are effective, but they require parenteral administration (UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux) and/or frequent anticoagulant monitoring (intravenous UFH, oral VKA). Novel anticoagulants in clinical testing include orally active direct factor II inhibitors [dabigatran etexilate (BIBR 1048), AZD0837)], parenteral direct factor II inhibitors (flovagatran sodium), orally active direct factor X inhibitors [rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939), apixaban, betrixaban, YM150, DU-176b, LY-517717, GW813893, TAK-442, PD 0348292] and new parenteral FXa inhibitors [idraparinux, idrabiotaparinux (biotinilated idraparinux; SSR 126517), ultra-low-molecular-weight heparins (ULMWH: AVE5026, RO-14)]. These new compounds have the potential to complement heparins and fondaparinux for short-term anticoagulation and/or to replace VKA for long-term anticoagulation in most patients. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been the firsts of the new oral anticoagulants to be licensed for the prevention of VTE after hip and knee replacement surgery. In the present review, we discuss the pharmacology of new anticoagulants, the key points necessary for interpreting the results of studies on VTE prophylaxis and treatment, the results of clinical trials testing these new compounds and their potential advantages and drawbacks over existing therapies.',\n",

A novel Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM Kinase II) inhibitor, KN-93 potently inhibits gastric acid secretion from parietal cells. As previously reported (1), treatment of parietal cells with a selective inhibitor of CaM kinase II, KN-62 resulted in the inhibition of cholinergic-stimulated rabbit parietal cell secretion, whereas it failed to inhibit the histamine and forskolin response. In contrast effects of carbachol, histamine and forskolin were significantly inhibited by KN-93 with an IC50 of 0.15, 0.3 and 1 microM, respectively; these effects occurred without any changes in intracellular cyclic AMP and Ca2+ levels. In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which KN-93 acts upon the acid-secreting machinery of gastric parietal cells. Neither redistribution of the proton pump activity nor the morphological transformation were affected by KN-93. The drug only weakly inhibited the H+, K(+)-ATPase activity but strongly dissipated the proton gradient formed in the gastric membrane vesicles and reduced the volume of luminal space. Thus KN-93 acts at pH gradient formation whereas KN-62 acts only at CaM Kinase II.',\n",

BACKGROUND: A malaria vaccine could be an important addition to current control strategies. We report the safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine during 18 mo following vaccination at 11 African sites with varying malaria transmission. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 6,537 infants aged 6-12 wk and 8,923 children aged 5-17 mo were randomized to receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01 or comparator vaccine. VE against clinical malaria in children during the 18 mo after vaccine dose 3 (per protocol) was 46% (95% CI 42% to 50%) (range 40% to 77%; VE, p<0.01 across all sites). VE during the 20 mo after vaccine dose 1 (intention to treat [ITT]) was 45% (95% CI 41% to 49%). VE against severe malaria, malaria hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalization was 34% (95% CI 15% to 48%), 41% (95% CI 30% to 50%), and 19% (95% CI 11% to 27%), respectively (ITT). VE against clinical malaria in infants was 27% (95% CI 20% to 32%, per protocol; 27% [95% CI 21% to 33%], ITT), with no significant protection against severe malaria, malaria hospitalization, or all-cause hospitalization. Post-vaccination anti-circumsporozoite antibody geometric mean titer varied from 348 to 787 EU/ml across sites in children and from 117 to 335 EU/ml in infants (per protocol). VE waned over time in both age categories (Schoenfeld residuals p<0.001). The number of clinical and severe malaria cases averted per 1,000 children vaccinated ranged across sites from 37 to 2,365 and from -1 to 49, respectively; corresponding ranges among infants were -10 to 1,402 and -13 to 37, respectively (ITT). Meningitis was reported as a serious adverse event in 16/5,949 and 1/2,974 children and in 9/4,358 and 3/2,179 infants in the RTS,S/AS01 and control groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RTS,S/AS01 prevented many cases of clinical and severe malaria over the 18 mo after vaccine dose 3, with the highest impact in areas with the greatest malaria incidence. VE was higher in children than in infants, but even at modest levels of VE, the number of malaria cases averted was substantial. RTS,S/AS01 could be an important addition to current malaria control in Africa. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00866619 Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary.\",\n",
              "  \"PET quantification of 5-HT2A receptors in the human brain: a constant infusion paradigm with [18F]altanserin. UNLABELLED: [18F]altanserin has been used to label serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, which are believed to be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and depression. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a constant infusion paradigm for equilibrium modeling of [18F]altanserin with PET. Kinetic modeling with [18F]altanserin may be hampered by the presence of lipophilic radiometabolites observed in plasma after intravenous administration. METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers were injected with [18F]altanserin as a bolus (208+/-9 MBq [5.62+/-0.25 mCi]) plus constant infusion (65+/-3 MBq/h [1.76+/-0.08 mCi/h]) ranging from 555 to 626 min (615+/-24 min) after injection. PET acquisitions (10-20 min) and venous blood sampling were performed every 30-60 min throughout the infusion period. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis revealed that time-activity curves for both brain activity and plasma [18F]altanserin and metabolite concentrations stabilized after about 6 h. This permitted equilibrium modeling and estimation of V3' (ratio of specific uptake [cortical-cerebellar] to total plasma parent concentration after 6 h). Values of V3' ranged from 1.57+/-0.38 for anterior cingulate cortex to 1.02+/-0.39 for frontal cortex. The binding potential V3 (ratio of specific uptake to free plasma parent concentration after 6 h, using group mean f1) was also calculated and ranged from 169+/-41 for anterior cingulate cortex to 110+/-42 for frontal cortex. From 6 h onward, the rate of change for V3' and V3 was only 1.11+/-1.69 %/h. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the feasibility of equilibrium imaging with [18F]altanserin over more than 5 radioactive half-lives and suggest a method to overcome difficulties associated with lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites. The stability in V3 and V3' once equilibrium is achieved suggests that a single PET acquisition obtained at 6 h may provide a reasonable measure of 5-HT2A receptor density.\",\n",
              "  'Novel details of calsequestrin gel conformation in situ. Calsequestrin (CASQ) is the major component of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) lumen in skeletal and cardiac muscles. This calcium-binding protein localizes to the junctional SR (jSR) cisternae, where it is responsible for the storage of large amounts of Ca(2+), whereas it is usually absent, at least in its polymerized form, in the free SR. The retention of CASQ inside the jSR is due partly to its association with other jSR proteins, such as junctin and triadin, and partly to its ability to polymerize, in a high Ca(2+) environment, into an intricate gel that holds the protein in place. In this work, we shed some light on the still poorly described in situ structure of polymerized CASQ using detailed EM images from thin sections, with and without tilting, and from deep-etched rotary-shadowed replicas. The latter directly illustrate the fundamental network nature of polymerized CASQ, revealing repeated nodal points connecting short segments of the linear polymer.',\n",
              "  \"Abnormal distribution of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor/alpha-synuclein in Lewy body disease as revealed by proteinase K and formic acid pretreatment. The precursor of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP) (also known as alpha-synuclein) is a presynaptic terminal molecule that abnormally accumulates in the plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the Lewy bodies (LBs) of Lewy body variant of AD, diffuse Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease. To better understand the distribution of NACP/alpha-synuclein and its fragments in the LB-bearing neurons and neurites, as well as to clarify the patterns of NACP/alpha-synuclein compartmentalization, we studied NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity using antibodies against the C-terminal, N-terminal, and NAC regions after Proteinase K and formic acid treatment in the cortex of patients with LBs. Furthermore, studies of the subcellular localization of NACP/alpha-synuclein within LB-bearing neurons were performed by immunogold electron microscopy. These studies showed that the N-terminal antibody immunolabeled the LBs and dystrophic neurites with great intensity and, to a lesser extent, the synapses. In contrast, the C-terminal antibody strongly labeled the synapses and, to a lesser extent, the LBs and dystrophic neurites. Whereas Proteinase K treatment enhanced NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity with the C-terminal antibody, it diminished the N-terminal NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. Furthermore, formic acid enhanced LB and dystrophic neurite labeling with both the C- and N-terminal antibodies. In addition, whereas without pretreatment only slight anti-NAC immunoreactivity was found in the LBs, formic acid pretreatment revealed an extensive anti-NAC immunostaining of LBs, plaques, and glial cells. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed within the amorphous electrodense material in the LBs and as small clusters in the filaments of LBs and neurites. These results support the view that aggregated NACP/alpha-synuclein might play an important role in the pathogenesis of disorders associated with LBs.\",\n",
              "  \"Overexpression of the human tissue kallikrein genes KLK4, 5, 6, and 7 increases the malignant phenotype of ovarian cancer cells. The human tissue kallikrein family of serine proteases (hK1-hK15 encoded by the genes KLK1-KLK15) is involved in several cancer-related processes. Accumulating evidence suggests that certain tissue kallikreins are part of an enzymatic cascade pathway that is activated in ovarian cancer and other malignant diseases. In the present study, OV-MZ-6 ovarian cancer cells were stably co-transfected with plasmids expressing hK4, hK5, hK6, and hK7. These cells displayed similar proliferative capacity as the vector-transfected control cells (which do not express any of the four tissue kallikreins), but showed significantly increased invasive behavior in an in vitro Matrigel invasion assay (p<0.01; Mann-Whitney U-test). For in vivo analysis, the cancer cells were inoculated into the peritoneum of nude mice. Simultaneous expression of hK4, hK5, hK6, and hK7 resulted in a remarkable 92% mean increase in tumor burden compared to the vector-control cell line. Five out of 14 mice in the 'tissue kallikrein overexpressing' group displayed a tumor/situs ratio greater than 0.198, while this weight limit was not exceeded at all in the vector control group consisting of 13 mice (p=0.017; chi2 test). Our results strongly support the view that tumor-associated overexpression of tissue kallikreins contributes to ovarian cancer progression.\",\n",
              "  'SERCA in genesis of arrhythmias: what we already know and what is new? This review mainly focuses on the structure, function of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) and its role in genesis of arrhythmias. SERCA is a membrane protein that belongs to the family of P-type ion translocating ATPases and pumps free cytosolic calcium into intracellular stores. Active transport of Ca2+ is achieved, according to the E1-E2 model, changing of SERCA structure by Ca2+. The affinity of Ca2+ -binding sites varies from high (E1) to low (E2). Three different SERCA genes were identified-SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3. SERCA is mainly represented by the SERCA2a isoform in the heart. In heart muscle, during systole, depolarization triggers the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and starts contraction. During diastole, muscle relaxation occurs as Ca2+ is again removed from cytosol, predominantly by accumulation into SR via the action of SERCA2a. The main regulator of SERCA2a is phospholamban and another regulator proteolipid of SERCA is sarcolipin. There are a lot of studies on the effect of decreased and/or increased SERCA activity in genesis of arrhythmia. Actually both decrease and increase of SERCA activity in the heart result in some pathological mechanisms such as heart failure and arrhythmia.',\n",
              "  'A meta-analysis of prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating endovascular therapies for acute ischemic stroke. INTRODUCTION: A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Multicenter Randomized CLinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), demonstrated better outcomes with endovascular treatment compared with medical therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, previous trials have provided mixed results regarding the efficacy of endovascular treatment for AIS. A meta-analysis of all available trial data was performed to summarize the available evidence. METHODS: A literature search was performed to identify all prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management for AIS. Two datasets were created: (1) all patients randomized after confirmation of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (consistent with the contemporary standard of practice at the majority of centers); and (2) all patients with outcome data who underwent randomization regardless of qualifying vascular imaging. The pre-specified primary outcome measure was modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. A fixed-effect model was used to determine significance. RESULTS: Five prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management were included in dataset 1 (1183 patients) and six were included in dataset 2 (1903 total patients). Endovascular therapies were associated with significantly improved outcomes compared with medical management (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.16, p=0.0001) for patients with LVO (dataset 1). This benefit persisted when patients from all six RCTs were included, even in the absence of confirmation of LVO (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.54, p=0.019; dataset 2). CONCLUSIONS: A meta-analysis of prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management demonstrates superior outcomes in patients randomized to endovascular therapy.',\n",
              "  'Site and sequence specific DNA methylation in the neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene includes C5839T: the site of the recurrent substitution mutation in exon 31. CpG dinucleotides provide hotspots for transitional mutations in a variety of genes, some leading to genetic diseases in humans. Although this phenomenon is attributed to cytosine methylation at such sites, direct and specific observations of CpG methylation at the sites of recurrent mutations are lacking. We have used a bisulfite genomic sequencing method to analyze DNA methylation within three representative exons from the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, well recognized for its high frequency of spontaneous mutations. We observed that the cytosine methylation within NF1 exons 28, 29, and 31 is restricted to CpG dinucleotides, including the CpG dinucleotide present at the site of the recurrent NF1 mutation (C5839T; also referred to as R1947X). At several sites, clone-specific methylation differences were also observed. Our results provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that methylatable CpGs in the NF1 gene contribute to spontaneous germline mutations associated with this gene, by showing that DNA methylation does occur at all CpGs contained within these representative NF1 exons. As well, the DNA methylation seen at the common mutation site in exon 31 may explain why this site is frequently mutated. Methylation-dependent mutagenesis may also provide a basis for some somatic (second hit) mutations which disable the normal allele and result in the development of NF1 associated symptoms.',\n",
              "  'Kinetic manifestation of processivity during multiple methylations catalyzed by SET domain protein methyltransferases. Processive versus distributive methyl group transfer was assessed for pea Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase, a SET domain protein lysine methyltransferase catalyzing the formation of trimethyllysine-14 in the large subunit of Rubisco. Catalytically competent complexes between an immobilized form of des(methyl) Rubisco and Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase were used to demonstrate enzyme release that was co-incident with and dependent on formation of trimethyllysine. Catalytic rate constants determined for formation of trimethyllysine were considerably lower ( approximately 10-fold) than rate constants determined for total radiolabel incorporation from [3H-methyl]-S-adenosylmethionine. Double-reciprocal velocity plots under catalytic conditions favoring monomethyllysine indicated a random or ordered reaction mechanism, while conditions favoring trimethyllysine suggested a hybrid ping-pong mechanism. These results were compared with double-reciprocal velocity plots and product analyses obtained for HsSET7/9 (a monomethyltransferase) and SpCLR4 (a dimethyltransferase) and suggest a predictive ability of double-reciprocal velocity plots for single versus multiple methyl group transfers by SET domain protein lysine methyltransferases. A model is proposed for SET domain protein lysine methyltransferases in which initial binding of polypeptide substrate and S-adenosylmethionine is random, with polypeptide binding followed by deprotonation of the epsilon-amine of the target lysyl residue and subsequent methylation. Following methyl group transfer, S-adenosylhomocysteine and monomethylated polypeptide dissociate from monomethyltransferases, but di- and trimethyltransferases begin a successive and catalytically obligatory deprotonation of enzyme-bound methylated lysyl intermediates, which along with binding and release of S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine is manifested as a hybrid ping-pong-like reaction mechanism.',\n",
              "  \"Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off - target effects on the cytoskeleton. Telomerase is a cellular ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that plays a crucial role in telomere maintenance. This enzyme is expressed in approximately 90% of human tumors, but not in the majority of normal somatic cells. imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit. In preclinical trials, this compound has been found to inhibit telomerase activity in multiple cancer cell lines, as well as in vivo xenograft mouse models. Currently, GRN163L is being investigated in several clinical trials, including a phase II human non - small cell lung cancer clinical trial, in a maintenance setting following standard doublet chemotherapy. In addition to the inhibition of telomerase activity in cancer cell lines, GRN163L causes morphological cell rounding changes, independent of hTR expression or telomere length. This leads to the loss of cell adhesion properties; however, the mechanism underlying this effect is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we observed that GRN163L treatment leads to the loss of adhesion in A549 lung cancer cells, due to decreased E-cadherin expression, leading to the disruption of the cytoskeleton through the alteration of actin, tubulin and intermediate filament organization. Consequently, the less adherent cancer cells initially cease to proliferate and are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, accompanied by decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression. These effects of GRN163L are independent of its telomerase catalytic activity and may increase the therapeutic efficacy of GRN163L by decreasing the adhesion, proliferation and metastatic potential of cancer cells in vivo.\",\n",
              "  \"Human delta Np73 regulates a dominant negative feedback loop for TAp73 and p53. Inactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 is the most common defect in cancer cells. p53 is a sequence specific transcription factor that is activated in response to various forms of genotoxic stress to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Induction of p53 is subjected to complex and strict control through several pathways, as it will often determine cellular fate. The p73 protein shares strong structural and functional similarities with p53 such as the potential to activate p53 responsive genes and the ability to induce apoptosis. In addition to alternative splicing at the carboxyl terminus which yields several p73 isoforms, a p73 variant lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain (Delta Np73) was described in mice. In this study, we report the cloning and characterisation of the human Delta Np73 isoforms, their regulation by p53 and their possible role in carcinogenesis. As in mice, human Delta Np73 lacks the transactivation domain and starts with an alternative exon (exon 3'). Its expression is driven by a second promoter located in a genomic region upstream of this exon, supporting the idea of two independently regulated proteins, derived from the same gene. As anticipated, Delta Np73 is capable of regulating TAp73 and p53 function since it is able to block their transactivation activity and their ability to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, expression of the Delta Np73 is strongly up-regulated by the TA isoforms and by p53, thus creating a feedback loop that tightly regulates the function of TAp73 and more importantly of p53. The regulation of Delta Np73 is exerted through a p53 responsive element located on the Delta N promoter. Expression of Delta Np73 not only regulates the function of p53 and TAp73 but also shuts off its own expression, once again finely regulating the whole system. Our data also suggest that increased expression of Delta Np73, functionally inactivating p53, could be involved in tumorogenesis. An extensive analysis of the expression pattern of Delta Np73 in primary tumours would clarify this issue.\",\n",
              "  'Gender differences in Latin-American patients with rheumatoid arthritis. BACKGROUND: Data on the effect of gender in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in non-Caucasian populations is scarce. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is a large population with unique characteristics, including high admixture. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the effect of gender in patients with RA in LAC. METHODS: This was a 2-phase study. First we conducted a cross-sectional and analytical study in which 1128 consecutive Colombian patients with RA were assessed. Second, a systematic review of the literature was done to evaluate the effect of gender in LAC patients with RA. RESULTS: Our results show a high prevalence of RA in LAC women with a ratio of 5.2 women per man. Colombian women with RA are more at risk of having an early age at onset and developing polyautoimmunity and abdominal obesity, and they perform more household duties than their male counterparts. However, male gender was associated with the presence of extra-articular manifestations. Of a total of 641 potentially relevant articles, 38 were considered for final analysis, in which several factors and outcomes related to gender were identified. CONCLUSIONS: RA in LAC women is not only more common but presents with some clinical characteristics that differ from RA presentation in men. Some of those characteristics could explain the high rates of disability and worse prognosis observed in women with RA in LAC.',\n",
              "  \"Two distinct SECIS structures capable of directing selenocysteine incorporation in eukaryotes. Translation of UGA as selenocysteine requires specific RNA secondary structures in the mRNAs of selenoproteins. These elements differ in sequence, structure, and location in the mRNA, that is, coding versus 3' untranslated region, in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. Analyses of eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements via computer folding programs, mutagenesis studies, and chemical and enzymatic probing has led to the derivation of a predicted consensus structural model for these elements. This model consists of a stem-loop or hairpin, with conserved nucleotides in the loop and in a non-Watson-Crick motif at the base of the stem. However, the sequences of a number of SECIS elements predict that they would diverge from the consensus structure in the loop region. Using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce mutations predicted to either disrupt or restore structure, or to manipulate loop size or stem length, we show that eukaryotic SECIS elements fall into two distinct classes, termed forms 1 and 2. Form 2 elements have additional secondary structures not present in form 1 elements. By either insertion or deletion of the sequences and structures distinguishing the two classes of elements while maintaining appropriate loop size, conversion of a form 1 element to a functional form 2-like element and of a form 2 to a functional form 1-like element was achieved. These results suggest commonality of function of the two classes. The information obtained regarding the existence of two classes of SECIS elements and the tolerances for manipulations of stem length and loop size should facilitate designing RNA molecules for obtaining high-resolution structural information about these elements.\",\n",

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether body mass index (BMI), as a proxy for body fat, influences rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity in a gender-specific manner. METHODS: Consecutive patients with RA were enrolled from 25 countries into the QUEST-RA program between 2005 and 2008. Clinical and demographic data were collected by treating rheumatologists and by patient self-report. Distributions of Disease Activity Scores (DAS28), BMI, age, and disease duration were assessed for each country and for the entire dataset; mean values between genders were compared using Student's t-tests. An association between BMI and DAS28 was investigated using linear regression, adjusting for age, disease duration and country. RESULTS: A total of 5,161 RA patients (4,082 women and 1,079 men) were included in the analyses. Overall, women were younger, had longer disease duration, and higher DAS28 scores than men, but BMI was similar between genders. The mean DAS28 scores increased with increasing BMI from normal to overweight and obese, among women, whereas the opposite trend was observed among men. Regression results showed BMI (continuous or categorical) to be associated with DAS28. Compared to the normal BMI range, being obese was associated with a larger difference in mean DAS28 (0.23, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.34) than being overweight (0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21); being underweight was not associated with disease activity. These associations were more pronounced among women, and were not explained by any single component of the DAS28. CONCLUSIONS: BMI appears to be associated with RA disease activity in women, but not in men.\",\n",
              "  'Use of flumazenil in intoxicated patients with coma. A double-blind placebo-controlled study in ICU. In a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective clinical trial we studied the efficacy and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. In 23 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients, including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). In the remaining 7 patients, needing two series of injections of flumazenil (up to 2.0 mg), GCS did not rise significantly and coma was related to intoxications with nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, flunitrazepam and in one patient, encephalitis. In the 10 patients receiving placebo, the GCS did not change. A significant increase in the GCS from 5.5 to 10.8 (p less than 0.001) was, however, observed when flumazenil (up to 1.0 mg) was given after placebo. In patients with EEG monitoring the changes in waveform pattern paralleled the clinical response. Effects could be detected within 1-2 min after flumazenil injection and lasted up to 45 min. There were no adverse reactions or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. The use of flumazenil is of diagnostic value in mixed-drug intoxications or coma of unknown origin and is of therapeutic importance for reversal of benzodiazepine intoxications.',\n",

A novel naphthylmethylimidazole derivative 1 and its related compounds were identified as 17,20-lyase inhibitors. Based on the structure-activity relationship around the naphthalene scaffold and the results of a docking study of 1a in the homology model of 17,20-lyase, the 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazole derivative (+)-3c was synthesized and identified as a potent and highly selective 17,20-lyase inhibitor. Biological evaluation of (+)-3c at a dose of 1mg/kg in a male monkey model revealed marked reductions in both serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone concentrations. Therefore, (+)-3c (termed orteronel [TAK-700]) was selected as a candidate for clinical evaluation and is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.',\n",
              "  'The cellular and molecular mechanisms for neutropenia in Barth syndrome. Barth syndrome (BTHS), a rare, X-linked, recessive disease, is characterized by neutropenia and cardiomyopathy. BTHS is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the tafazzin (TAZ) gene. We developed a model of BTHS by transfecting human HL60 myeloid progenitor cells with TAZ-specific shRNAs. Results demonstrate a significant downregulation in TAZ expression, mimicking the effects of naturally occurring truncation mutations in TAZ. Flow cytometry analyses of cells with TAZ-specific, but not scrambled, shRNAs demonstrate nearly twofold increase in the proportion of annexin V-positive cells and significantly increased dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential as determined by DIOC6 staining. Transfection of TAZ-specific shRNA had similar effects in U937 myeloid cells but not in lymphoid cell lines. Further studies in HL60 myeloid progenitor cells revealed aberrant release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and significantly elevated levels of activated caspase-3 in response to TAZ knockdown. Treatment with caspase-specific inhibitor zVAD-fmk resulted in substantially reduced apoptosis to near-normal levels. These data suggest that neutropenia in BTHS is attributable to increased dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, aberrant release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, and accelerated apoptosis of myeloid progenitor cells, and that this defect can be partially restored in vitro by treatment with caspase-specific inhibitors.',\n",
              "  'A new cardioprotective agent, JTV519, improves defective channel gating of ryanodine receptor in heart failure. Defective interaction between FKBP12.6 and ryanodine receptors (RyR) is a possible cause of cardiac dysfunction in heart failure (HF). Here, we assess whether the new cardioprotective agent JTV519 can correct it in tachycardia-induced HF. HF was induced in dogs by 4-wk rapid ventricular pacing, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was isolated from left ventricular muscles. In failing SR, JTV519 increased the rate of Ca(2+) release and [(3)H]ryanodine binding. RyR were then labeled in a site-directed fashion with the fluorescent conformational probe methylcoumarin acetamide. In failing SR, the polylysine induced a rapid change in methylcoumarin acetamide fluorescence, presumably because the channel opening preceding the Ca(2+) release was smaller than in normal SR (consistent with a decreased rate of Ca(2+) release in failing SR), and JTV519 increased it. In conclusion, JTV519, a new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, corrected the defective channel gating in RyR (increase in both the rapid conformational change and the subsequent Ca(2+) release rate) in HF.',\n",
              "  'Can the FAST and ROSIER adult stroke recognition tools be applied to confirmed childhood arterial ischemic stroke? BACKGROUND: Stroke recognition tools have been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy in adults. Development of a similar tool in children is needed to reduce lag time to diagnosis. A critical first step is to determine whether adult stoke scales can be applied in childhood stroke.Our objective was to assess the applicability of adult stroke scales in childhood arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) METHODS: Children aged 1 month to < 18 years with radiologically confirmed acute AIS who presented to a tertiary emergency department (ED) (2003 to 2008) were identified retrospectively. Signs, symptoms, risk factors and initial management were extracted. Two adult stroke recognition tools; ROSIER (Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room) and FAST (Face Arm Speech Test) scales were applied retrospectively to all patients to determine test sensitivity. RESULTS: 47 children with AIS were identified. 34 had anterior, 12 had posterior and 1 child had anterior and posterior circulation infarcts. Median age was 9 years and 51% were male. Median time from symptom onset to ED presentation was 21 hours but one third of children presented within 6 hours. The most common presenting stroke symptoms were arm (63%), face (62%), leg weakness (57%), speech disturbance (46%) and headache (46%). The most common signs were arm (61%), face (70%) or leg weakness (57%) and dysarthria (34%). 36 (78%) of children had at least one positive variable on FAST and 38 (81%) had a positive score of > 1 on the ROSIER scale. Positive scores were less likely in children with posterior circulation stroke. CONCLUSION: The presenting features of pediatric stroke appear similar to adult strokes. Two adult stroke recognition tools have fair to good sensitivity in radiologically confirmed childhood AIS but require further development and modification. Specificity of the tools also needs to be determined in a prospective cohort of children with stroke and non-stroke brain attacks.',\n",
              "  \"Two novel exonic point mutations in HEXA identified in a juvenile Tay-Sachs patient: role of alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. We have identified three mutations in the beta-hexoseaminidase A (HEXA) gene in a juvenile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) patient, which exhibited a reduced level of HEXA mRNA. Two mutations are novel, c.814G>A (p.Gly272Arg) and c.1305C>T (p.=), located in exon 8 and in exon 11, respectively. The third mutation, c.1195A>G (p.Asn399Asp) in exon 11, has been previously characterized as a common polymorphism in African-Americans. Hex A activity measured in TSD Glial cells, transfected with HEXA cDNA constructs bearing these mutations, was unaltered from the activity level measured in normal HEXA cDNA. Analysis of RT-PCR products revealed three aberrant transcripts in the patient, one where exon 8 was absent, one where exon 11 was absent and a third lacking both exons 10 and 11. All three novel transcripts contain frameshifts resulting in premature termination codons (PTCs). Transfection of mini-gene constructs carrying the c.814G>A and c.1305C>T mutations proved that the two mutations result in exon skipping. mRNAs that harbor a PTC are detected and degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway to prevent synthesis of abnormal proteins. However, although NMD is functional in the patient's fibroblasts, aberrant transcripts are still present. We suggest that the level of correctly spliced transcripts as well as the efficiency in which NMD degrade the PTC-containing transcripts, apparently plays an important role in the phenotype severity of the unique patient and thus should be considered as a potential target for drug therapy.\",\n",

Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) experience pathologic fractures, bone pain, hypercalcemia, neurologic symptoms, and renal insufficiency with substantial morbidity and mortality. Bisphosphonates have been used successfully for the management of MM-related bone disease. Increased incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw has been observed in patients with cancer receiving bisphosphonate therapy. Recent advances in the pathobiology of MM-related bone disease and other cancer-related bone metastases have led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets, such as receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK); its ligand (RANKL); and a decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin, for the development of potential targeted agents. Initials studies have demonstrated that targeting RANK/ RANKL signaling with the fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab prevented skeletal complications in patients with MM and other cancers with bone metastases. Ongoing studies evaluating the clinical utility of denosumab in cancer- related bone destruction have been discussed. In addition, several potential targets, such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, chemokine receptors 1 and 5, interleukin-3, and Wnt signaling, are b riefly described.',\n",
              "  'The mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B are also DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine dehydroxymethylases. For cytosine (C) demethylation of vertebrate DNA, it is known that the TET proteins could convert 5-methyl C (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl C (5-hmC). However, DNA dehydroxymethylase(s), or enzymes able to directly convert 5-hmC to C, have been elusive. We present in vitro evidence that the mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, but not the maintenance enzyme DNMT1, are also redox-dependent DNA dehydroxymethylases. Significantly, intactness of the C methylation catalytic sites of these de novo enzymes is also required for their 5-hmC dehydroxymethylation activity. That DNMT3A and DNMT3B function bidirectionally both as DNA methyltransferases and as dehydroxymethylases raises intriguing and new questions regarding the structural and functional aspects of these enzymes and their regulatory roles in the dynamic modifications of the vertebrate genomes during development, carcinogenesis, and gene regulation.',\n",
              "  'Dynamic regulation of mitochondrial fission through modification of the dynamin-related protein Drp1. Mitochondria in cells comprise a tubulovesicular network shaped continuously by complementary fission and fusion events. The mammalian Drp1 protein plays a key role in fission, while Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 are required for fusion. Shifts in the balance between these opposing processes can occur rapidly, indicating that modifications to these proteins may regulate mitochondrial membrane dynamics. We highlight posttranslational modifications of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, for which these regulatory mechanisms are best characterized. This dynamin-related GTPase undergoes a number of steps to mediate mitochondrial fission, including translocation from cytoplasm to the mitochondrial outer membrane, higher-order assembly into spirals, GTP hydrolysis associated with a conformational change and membrane deformation, and ultimately disassembly. Many of these steps may be influenced by covalent modification of Drp1. We discuss the dynamic nature of Drp1 modifications and how they contribute not only to the normal regulation of mitochondrial division, but also to neuropathologic processes.',\n",
              "  \"When blood transfusion medicine becomes complicated due to interference by monoclonal antibody therapy. BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) are increasingly integrated in the standard of care. The notion that therapeutic MoAbs can interfere with clinical laboratory tests is an emerging concern that requires immediate recognition and the development of appropriate solutions. Here, we describe that treatment of multiple myeloma patients with daratumumab, a novel anti-CD38 MoAb, resulted in false-positive indirect antiglobulin tests (IATs) for all patients for 2 to 6 months after infusion. This precluded the correct identification of irregular blood group antibodies for patients requiring blood transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The IAT was performed using three- and 11-donor-cell panels. Interference of daratumumab and three other anti-CD38 MoAbs was studied using fresh-frozen plasma spiked with different MoAb concentrations. Additionally it was tested whether two potentially neutralizing agents, anti-idiotype antibody and recombinant soluble CD38 (sCD38) extracellular domain, were able to inhibit the interference. RESULTS: The CD38 MoAbs caused agglutination in the IAT in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of an excess of anti-idiotype antibodies or sCD38 protein to the test abrogated CD38 MoAb interference and successfully restored irregular antibody screening and identification. DISCUSSION: CD38 MoAb therapy causes false-positive results in the IAT. The reliability of the test could be restored by adding a neutralizing agent against the CD38 MoAb to the patient's plasma. This study emphasizes that during drug development, targeted therapeutics should be investigated for potential interference with laboratory tests. Clinical laboratories should be informed when patients receive MoAb treatments and matched laboratory tests to prevent interference should be employed.\",\n",
              "  'Inhibitory profile of SEA0400 [2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline] assessed on the cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, NCX1.1. SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline) has recently been described as a potent and selective inhibitor of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange in cardiac, neuronal, and renal preparations. The inhibitory effects of SEA0400 were investigated on the cloned cardiac Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger, NCX1.1, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes to gain insight into its inhibitory mechanism. Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange currents were measured using the giant excised patch technique using conditions to evaluate both inward and outward currents. SEA0400 inhibited outward Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange currents with high affinity (IC(50) = 78 +/- 15 and 23 +/- 4 nM for peak and steady-state currents, respectively). Considerably less inhibitory potency (i.e., micromolar) was observed for inward currents. The inhibitory profile was reexamined after proteolytic treatment of excised patches with alpha-chymotrypsin, a procedure that eliminates ionic regulatory mechanisms. After this treatment, an IC(50) value of 1.2 +/- 0.6 microM was estimated for outward currents, whereas inward currents became almost insensitive to SEA0400. The inhibitory effects of SEA0400 on outward exchange currents were evident at both high and low concentrations of regulatory Ca(2+), although distinct features were noted. SEA0400 accelerated the inactivation rate of outward currents. Based on paired pulse experiments, SEA0400 altered the recovery of exchangers from the Na(+)(i)-dependent inactive state, particularly at higher regulatory Ca(2+)(i) concentrations. Finally, the inhibitory potency of SEA0400 was strongly dependent on the intracellular Na(+) concentration. Our data confirm that SEA0400 is the most potent inhibitor of the cardiac Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger described to date and provide a reasonable explanation for its apparent transport mode selectivity.',\n",
              "  'Flumazenil use in benzodiazepine overdose in the UK: a retrospective survey of NPIS data. OBJECTIVE: Benzodiazepine (BZD) overdose (OD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the UK. Flumazenil is an effective antidote but there is a risk of seizures, particularly in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. A study was undertaken to examine the frequency of use, safety and efficacy of flumazenil in the management of BZD OD in the UK. METHODS: A 2-year retrospective cohort study was performed of all enquiries to the UK National Poisons Information Service involving BZD OD. RESULTS: Flumazenil was administered to 80 patients in 4504 BZD-related enquiries, 68 of whom did not have ventilatory failure or had recognised contraindications to flumazenil. Factors associated with flumazenil use were increased age, severe poisoning and ventilatory failure. Co-ingestion of tricyclic antidepressants and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease did not influence flumazenil administration. Seizure frequency in patients not treated with flumazenil was 0.3%. The frequency of prior seizure in flumazenil-treated patients was 30 times higher (8.8%). Seven patients who had seizures prior to flumazenil therapy had no recurrence of their seizures. Ventilation or consciousness improved in 70% of flumazenil-treated patients. Flumazenil administration was followed by one instance each of agitation and brief seizure. CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil is used infrequently in the management of BZD OD in the UK. It was effective and associated with a low incidence of seizure. These results compare favourably with the results of published randomised controlled trials and cohort studies, although previous studies have not reported the use of flumazenil in such a high-risk population. This study should inform the continuing review of national guidance on flumazenil therapy.',\n",

              "  'Differential control of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 protein stability by the ring finger ubiquitin ligase PIR2. p73 is a p53-related transcription factor with fundamental roles in development and tumor suppression. Transcription from two different promoters on the p73 gene results in generation of transcriptionally active TAp73 isoforms and dominant negative DeltaNp73 isoforms with opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic functions. Therefore, the relative ratio of each isoform is an important determinant of the cell fate. Proteasomal degradation of p73 is mediated by polyubiquitination-dependent and -independent processes both of which appear, thus far, to lack selectivity for the TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. Here, we describe the characterization of another transcriptional target of TAp73; a ring finger domain ubiquitin ligase p73 Induced RING 2 protein (PIR2). Although PIR2 was initially identified a p53-induced gene (p53RFP), low abundance of PIR2 transcript in mouse embryonic fibroblasts of TAp73 KO mice compared with WT mice and comparison of PIR2 mRNA and protein levels following TAp73 or p53 overexpression substantiate TAp73 isoforms as strong inducers of PIR2. Although PIR2 expression was induced by DNA damage, its expression did not alter apoptotic response or cell cycle profile per se. However, coexpression of PIR2 with TAp73 or DeltaNp73 resulted in an increase of the TA/DeltaNp73 ratio, due to preferential degradation of DeltaNp73. Finally, PIR2 was able to relieve the inhibitory effect of DeltaNp73 on TAp73 induced apoptosis following DNA damage. These results suggest that PIR2, by being induced by TAp73 and degrading DeltaNp73, differentially regulates TAp73/DeltaNp73 stability, and, hence, it may offer a therapeutic approach to enhance the chemosensitivity of tumor cells.',\n",
              "  'An Ash2L/RbBP5 heterodimer stimulates the MLL1 methyltransferase activity through coordinated substrate interactions with the MLL1 SET domain. Histone H3 lysine 4 (K4) methylation is a prevalent mark associated with transcription activation and is mainly catalyzed by the MLL/SET1 family histone methyltransferases. A common feature of the mammalian MLL/SET1 complexes is the presence of three core components (RbBP5, Ash2L and WDR5) and a catalytic subunit containing a SET domain. Unlike most other histone lysine methyltransferases, all four proteins are required for efficient H3 K4 methylation. Despite extensive efforts, mechanisms for how three core components regulate MLL/SET1 methyltransferase activity remain elusive. Here we show that a heterodimer of Ash2L and RbBP5 has intrinsic histone methyltransferase activity. This activity requires the highly conserved SPRY domain of Ash2L and a short peptide of RbBP5. We demonstrate that both Ash2L and the MLL1 SET domain are capable of binding to S-adenosyl-L- [methyl-(3)H] methionine in the MLL1 core complex. Mutations in the MLL1 SET domain that fail to support overall H3 K4 methylation also compromise SAM binding by Ash2L. Taken together, our results show that the Ash2L/RbBP5 heterodimer plays a critical role in the overall catalysis of MLL1 mediated H3 K4 methylation. The results we describe here provide mechanistic insights for unique regulation of the MLL1 methyltransferase activity. It suggests that both Ash2L/RbBP5 and the MLL1 SET domain make direct contacts with the substrates and contribute to the formation of a joint catalytic center. Given the shared core configuration among all MLL/SET1 family HMTs, it will be interesting to test whether the mechanism we describe here can be generalized to other MLL/SET1 family members in the future.',\n",
              "  \"Aluminum induces neurodegeneration and its toxicity arises from increased iron accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The neurotoxicity of aluminum (Al) - the most abundant metal element on earth - has been known for years. However, the mechanism of Al-induced neurodegeneration and its relationship to Alzheimer's disease are still controversial. In particular, in vivo functional data are lacking. In a Drosophila model with chronic dietary Al overloading, general neurodegeneration and several behavioral changes were observed. Al-induced neurodegeneration is independent of β-amyloid or tau-associated toxicity, suggesting they act in different molecular pathways. Interestingly, Drosophila frataxin (dfh), which causes Friedreich's ataxia if mutated in humans, displayed an interacting effect with Al, suggesting Friedreich's ataxia patients might be more susceptible to Al toxicity. Al-treated flies accumulated large amount of iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and exhibited elevated SOD2 activity. Genetic and pharmacological efforts to reduce ROS or chelate excess Fe significantly mitigated Al toxicity. Our results indicate that Al toxicity is mediated through ROS production and iron accumulation and suggest a remedial route to reduce toxicity due to Al exposure.\",\n",
              "  \"Widespread expression of alpha-synuclein and tau immunoreactivity in Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome with protracted clinical course. Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome (HSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by extrapyramidal signs and progressive dementia. In a typical case, the clinical symptoms become apparent during late childhood, and usually the course is protracted over a decade or more. We recently had an opportunity to study the brains of two cases of HSS with a clinical course of over 30 years. Case 1 was a 44-year-old female and case 2 was a 37-year-old male. Grossly, the brains showed severe fronto-temporal lobar atrophy with abundant spheroids and mild iron deposits in the globus pallidus, associated with features of motor neuron disease. In addition, there was diffuse sponginess in the atrophic cortex as well as widespread Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and Lewy bodies (LBs) in the cortical and subcortical regions, including the spinal cord. Ultrastructurally, NFTs were composed of paired helical filaments, and LBs of central dense cores with radiating fibrils. Discrete immunostaining was demonstrated in NFTs and neuropil threads with various antibodies against phosphorylated tau, and in LBs with antibody against alpha-synuclein. In addition, diffuse, overlapping immunoreactivity of alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated tau was seen within the cytoplasm of many neurons. However, when LBs and NFTs coexisted within the same neurons, they were clearly segregated. The findings of our present cases as well as those reported in the literature may indicate that simultaneous and extensive occurrence of abnormal phosphorylation of tau and accumulation of alpha-synuclein may constitute cardinal pathological features of HSS with protracted clinical course.\",\n",

At least six major steps are required for secreted thyroid hormone (TH) to exert its action on target tissues. Mutations interfering with three of these steps have been so far identified. The first recognized defect, which causes resistance to TH, involves the TH receptor beta gene and has been given the acronym RTH. Occurring in approximately 1 per 40,000 newborns, more than 1000 affected subjects, from 339 families, have been identified. The gene defect remains unknown in 15% of subjects with RTH. Two novel syndromes causing reduced sensitivity to TH were recently identified. One, producing severe psychomotor defects in > 100 males from 26 families, is caused by mutations in the cell-membrane transporter of TH, MCT8; the second, affecting the intracellular metabolism of TH in four individuals from two families, is caused by mutations in the SECISBP2 gene, which is required for the synthesis of selenoproteins, including TH deiodinases.',\n",

              "  \"A highly sensitive genetic protocol to detect NF1 mutations. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. Detecting mutation in NF1 is hindered by the gene's large size, the lack of mutation hotspots, the presence of pseudogenes, and the wide variety of possible lesions. We developed a method for detecting germline mutations by combining an original RNA-based cDNA-PCR mutation detection method and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The protocol was validated in a cohort of 56 blood samples from NF1 patients who fulfilled NIH diagnostic criteria, identifying the germline mutation in 53 cases (95% sensitivity). The efficiency and reliability of this approach facilitated detection of different types of mutations, including single-base substitutions, deletions or insertions of one to several nucleotides, microdeletions, and changes in intragenic copy number. Because mutational screening for minor lesions was performed using cDNA and the characterization of mutated alleles was performed at both the RNA and genomic DNA level, the analysis provided insight into the nature of the different mutations and their effect on NF1 mRNA splicing. After validation, we implemented the protocol as a routine test. Here we present the overall unbiased spectrum of NF1 mutations identified in 93 patients in a cohort of 105. The results indicate that this protocol is a powerful new tool for the molecular diagnosis of NF1.\",\n",
              "  'The p73 gene is an anti-tumoral target of the RARbeta/gamma-selective retinoid tazarotene. Tazarotene, a member of the new class of acetylenic retinoids, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of several hyperproliferative skin diseases, including non-melanoma skin cancer. Its effectiveness is thought to rely on the ability to activate retinoic acid receptors beta and gamma and to induce a number of downstream anti-proliferative genes. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73 is a target of tazarotene. Indeed, tazarotene modulates the expression of the p73 gene in immortalized keratinocyte cell lines by inducing the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative TAp73 isoforms and by repressing the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative DeltaNp73 isoforms. This occurs at the transcriptional level through a coordinated action on P1p73 and P2p73 promoters that control the expression of TA and DeltaN isoforms, respectively. The selective downregulation of DeltaNp73 expression by small interfering RNA led to an enhancement of tazarotene-induced bax activation and apoptosis, whereas the downregulation of both TA and DeltaN isoforms impairs tazarotene-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate the relevance of p73 gene products in tazarotene-induced growth inhibition and effectiveness in the treatment of skin tumors.',\n",

              "  'A new procedure for extraction of collagen from modern and archaeological bones for 14C dating. Bones are potentially the best age indicators in a stratigraphic study, because they are closely related to the layer in which they are found. Collagen is the most suitable fraction and is the material normally used in radiocarbon dating. Bone contaminants can strongly alter the carbon isotopic fraction values of the samples, so chemical pretreatment for (14)C dating by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is essential. The most widespread method for collagen extraction is based on the Longin procedure, which consists in HCl demineralization to dissolve the inorganic phase of the samples, followed by dissolution of collagen in a weak acid solution. In this work the possible side effects of this procedure on a modern bone are presented; the extracted collagen was analyzed by ATR-IR spectroscopy. An alternative procedure, based on use of HF instead of HCl, to minimize unwanted degradation of the organic fraction, is also given. A study by ATR-IR spectroscopic analysis of collagen collected after different demineralization times and with different acid volumes, and a study of an archaeological sample, are also presented.',\n",
              "  'The new oral anticoagulants: a challenge for hospital formularies. Introduction Over the past 60 years, clinicians have used vitamin K antagonists, primarily warfarin, as the sole oral anticoagulants for managing a variety of thrombotic disorders. Warfarin, which requires frequent monitoring, has a variable dose response, a narrow therapeutic index, and numerous drug and dietary interactions. However, intravenous and subcutaneous agents, such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccharide, have been introduced over the past 30 years for managing thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced into clinical trials. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa. These drugs have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring in order to adjust therapy, which is the mainstay of warfarin management. In addition, these new medications have not shown any major issues regarding food interactions; rather, they demonstrate the potential for limited drug-drug interactions due to their limited metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. This unique pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders. Two of these agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); in addition, rivaroxaban can be used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in total hip and knee arthroplasty during the acute and extended periods of risk. However, the challenge for hospital formularies will be the appropriate use and management of these new medications as they become integrated into outpatient care. In order to better understand the issues that pharmacy and therapeutics committees will encounter, a review of the 2 FDA-approved oral anticoagulants will be evaluated.',\n",
              "  'Heterologous expression of the C-terminal antigenic domain of the malaria vaccine candidate Pfs48/45 in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Malaria is a widespread and infectious disease that is a leading cause of death in many parts of the world. Eradication of malaria has been a major world health goal for decades, but one that still remains elusive. Other diseases have been eradicated using vaccination, but traditional vaccination methods have thus far been unsuccessful for malaria. Infection by Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria, is currently treated with drug-based therapies, but an increase in drug resistance has led to the need for new methods of treatment. A promising strategy for malaria treatment is to combine transmission blocking vaccines (TBVs) that prevent spread of disease with drug-based therapies to treat infected individuals. TBVs can be developed against surface protein antigens that are expressed during parasite reproduction in the mosquito. When the mosquito ingests blood from a vaccinated individual harboring the Plasmodium parasite, the antibodies generated by vaccination prevent completion of the parasites life-cycle. Animal studies have shown that immunization with Pfs48/45 results in the production of malaria transmission blocking antibodies; however, the development of this vaccine candidate has been hindered by poor expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. Recently, the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used to express complex recombinant proteins. In this study, we show that the C-terminal antigenic region of the Pfs48/45 antigen can be expressed in the chloroplast of the green algae C. reinhardtii and that this recombinant protein has a conformation recognized by known transmission blocking antibodies. Production of this protein in algae has the potential to scale to the very large volumes required to meet the needs of millions at risk for contracting malaria.',\n",

Shigella infection in epithelial cells induces cell death which is accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study the role of the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1 during Shigella infection in HeLa cells was examined. Significant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was detected in the culture supernatant when HeLa cells were infected with Shigella at a high multiplicity of infection. Drp1 inhibition with Mdivi-1 and siRNA knockdown significantly reduced LDH release. HeLa cell death was also accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation. Tubular mitochondrial networks were partially restored when Drp1 was depleted with either siRNA or inhibited with Mdivi-1. Surprisingly either Mdivi-1 treatment or Drp1 siRNA-depletion of HeLa cells also reduced Shigella plaque formation. The effect of Mdivi-1 on Shigella infection was assessed using the murine Sereny model, however it had no impact on ocular inflammation. Overall our results suggest that Drp1 and the mitochondria play important roles during Shigella infection.',\n",

An adjustment of sex ratio of offspring to the conditions present at conception is seen in many mammals including horses. This depends on preferential survival of male embryos under conditions of high energy intake. In several species, growth factors including insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1 have been shown to promote embryonic development by decreasing apoptosis and increasing cell proliferation. We hypothesized that sex-related differences in IGF-1 expression in equine embryos during the phase of maternal recognition of pregnancy might exist and thus contribute to preferential survival of embryos from either of both sexes under specific environmental conditions. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression of in\\xa0vivo-produced equine embryos on different days of pregnancy (Day 8, N = 6; Day 10, N = 8; Day 12, N = 14) was analyzed. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was evaluated by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The sex of the embryo was determined by detection of X-inactivation specific transcript (Xist) RNA and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome DNA. Embryos positive for Xist expression were classified as female, and Xist negative and equine sex determining region of the Y chromosome positive embryos were classified as male. From 28 embryos tested, 15 (54%) showed positive Xist expression and were thus classified as female. Insulin like growth factor-1 mRNA expression was influenced by sex (P\\xa0= 0.01) but not by day of pregnancy (relative expression of IGF-1 in relation to β-actin, Day 8: male 5.1 ± 2.1, female 11.4; Day 10: male 5.2 ± 1.6, female 17.4 ± 6.7; Day 12: male 2.6 ± 0.3, female 11.6 ± 2.4). Results demonstrate an increased expression of IGF-1 in female equine embryos. Sex-related influences on expression of the IGF system are probably related to a gradual X chromosome inactivation.',\n",
              "  'Abnormal calcium signaling and sudden cardiac death associated with mutation of calsequestrin. Mutations in human cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2), a high-capacity calcium-binding protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), have recently been linked to effort-induced ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). However, the precise mechanisms through which these mutations affect SR function and lead to arrhythmia are presently unknown. In this study, we explored the effect of adenoviral-directed expression of a canine CASQ2 protein carrying the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-linked mutation D307H (CASQ2(D307H)) on Ca2+ signaling in adult rat myocytes. Total CASQ2 protein levels were consistently elevated approximately 4-fold in cells infected with adenoviruses expressing either wild-type CASQ2 (CASQ2(WT)) or CASQ2(D307H). Expression of CASQ2(D307H) reduced the Ca2+ storing capacity of the SR. In addition, the amplitude, duration, and rise time of macroscopic I(Ca)-induced Ca2+ transients and of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks were reduced significantly in myocytes expressing CASQ2(D307H). Myocytes expressing CASQ2(D307H) also displayed drastic disturbances of rhythmic oscillations in [Ca2+]i and membrane potential, with signs of delayed afterdepolarizations when undergoing periodic pacing and exposed to isoproterenol. Importantly, normal rhythmic activity was restored by loading the SR with the low-affinity Ca2+ buffer, citrate. Our data suggest that the arrhythmogenic CASQ2(D307H) mutation impairs SR Ca2+ storing and release functions and destabilizes the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism by reducing the effective Ca2+ buffering inside the SR and/or by altering the responsiveness of the Ca2+ release channel complex to luminal Ca2+. These results establish at the cellular level the pathological link between CASQ2 mutations and the predisposition to adrenergically mediated arrhythmias observed in patients carrying CASQ2 defects.',\n",
              "  'The arrhythmogenic substrate of the long QT syndrome: genetic basis, pathology, and pathophysiologic mechanisms. The Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a relatively rare disorder. It has a major clinical impact as affected individuals are prone to syncope and sudden arrhythmogenic cardiac death. The LQTS comprises three groups of patients. The Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome is characterized by an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and congenital neural deafness. The Romano-Ward syndrome shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and normal hearing. Patients with the sporadic form of LQTS have no evidence of familial transmission and have normal hearing. Imbalance of sympathetic cardiac innervation with predominance of the left stellate ganglion and an intrinsic myocardial defect leading to early afterdepolarization are the two pathogenetic mechanisms of LQTS discussed today. More recently a genetic basis for the Romano-Ward LQTS has been reported. The genetic linkage to the Harvey ras-1 gene provides the basis for a new hypothesis that an impairment of guanine nucleotide binding proteins is responsible for symptoms observed in LQTS. This paper discusses the genetic basis, pathology and pathophysiology of LQTS and tries to unify the different theories.',\n",
              "  'Regulation of anthrax toxin activator gene (atxA) expression in Bacillus anthracis: temperature, not CO2/bicarbonate, affects AtxA synthesis. Anthrax toxin gene expression in Bacillus anthracis is dependent on the presence of atxA, a trans-acting regulatory gene located on the resident 185-kb plasmid pXO1. In atxA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is enhanced by two physiologically significant signals: elevated CO2/bicarbonate and temperature. To determine whether increased toxin gene expression in response to these signals is associated with increased atxA expression, we monitored steady-state levels of atxA mRNA and AtxA protein in cells cultured in different conditions. We purified histidine-tagged AtxA [AtxA(His)] from Escherichia coli and used anti-AtxA(His) serum to detect AtxA in protein preparations from B. anthracis cells. AtxA was identified as a protein with an apparent size of 56 kDa in cytoplasmic fractions of B. anthracis cells. Our data indicate that atxA expression is not influenced by CO2/bicarbonate levels. However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cells grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate at 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higher than that observed in cells grown in the same conditions at 28 degrees C. A corresponding difference in AtxA protein was also seen at the different growth temperatures. When atxA was cloned on a multicopy plasmid in B. anthracis, AtxA levels corresponding to the atxA gene copy number were observed. However, this strain produced significantly less pag mRNA and protective antigen protein than the parental strain harboring atxA in single copy on pXO1. These results indicate that increased AtxA expression does not lead to a corresponding increase in pag expression. Our data strongly suggest that an additional factor(s) is involved in regulation of pag and that the relative amounts of such a factor(s) and AtxA are important for optimal toxin gene expression.',\n",

Several available anti-FXa assays are used for monitoring anticoagulant activity of heparins and fondaparinux. They must be modified and standardized for the measurement of direct FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban and others). The use of calibrators (lyophilized plasma with a known concentration of drug) allows an expression of the results in ng per ml of plasma. Two categories of assays - endogenous and exogenous assays are available. Endogenous assays are useful in pharmaceutical research, while exogenous assays are used in clinical laboratories. The preferred anti-FXa assay is a specific method in contrast to prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, but it is not available everywhere at any time. A specific measurement of direct FXa inhibitors is feasible with the use of a new test developed by the authors' group. The physicians must be aware of the possibility to measure the plasma concentration of FXa inhibitors in patients at high risk of bleeding and in several other special clinical situations.\",\n",
              "  '[Pharmacologic and clinical characteristics of direct inhibitors of factor Xa: rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban]. Heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) used commonly are the standard treatment of venous and arterial thromboses. They are very efficient and safe, but have some limitations: iatrogenicity, laboratory monitoring, parenteral use for heparins and fondaparinux. Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The objective is to substitute these indirect inhibitors of factor Xa (heparins, low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux) in the prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic episodes. The new direct inhibitors do not require routine laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation. They inhibit the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are efficacious and safe in the prevention of cerebral infarcts in patients with non-valvular fibrillation. Apixaban is another direct inhibitor of factor Xa used orally which is developed in the same indications as rivaroxaban. Edoxaban and betrixaban are also in development. The objective of this work is to study the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, the efficacy and safety of these four oral direct factor Xa inhibitors.',\n",
              "  'Chromosome XII context is important for rDNA function in yeast. The rDNA cluster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is located 450 kb from the left end and 610 kb from the right end of chromosome XII and consists of approximately 150 tandemly repeated copies of a 9.1 kb rDNA unit. To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number. The frequency of silencing of URA3 inserted within the rDNA locus was found to be greater than in a wild-type strain. The localization and morphology of the nucleolus was also affected such that a single and occasionally (6-12% frequency) two foci for Nop1p and a rounded nucleolus were observed, whereas a typical crescent-shaped nucleolar structure was seen in the wild-type strain. Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spans than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles. These observations suggest that the context of chromosome XII plays an important role in maintaining a constant rDNA copy number and in physiological processes related to rDNA function in S.cerevisiae.',\n",
              "  'Alteration of POLDIP3 splicing associated with loss of function of TDP-43 in tissues affected with ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by selective loss of motor neurons. In the ALS motor neurons, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is dislocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm and forms inclusions, suggesting that loss of a nuclear function of TDP-43 may underlie the pathogenesis of ALS. TDP-43 functions in RNA metabolism include regulation of transcription, mRNA stability, and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. However, a function of TDP-43 in tissue affected with ALS has not been elucidated. We sought to identify the molecular indicators reflecting on a TDP-43 function. Using exon array analysis, we observed a remarkable alteration of splicing in the polymerase delta interacting protein 3 (POLDIP3) as a result of the depletion of TDP-43 expression in two types of cultured cells. In the cells treated with TDP-43 siRNA, wild-type POLDIP3 (variant-1) decreased and POLDIP3 lacking exon 3 (variant-2) increased. The RNA binding ability of TDP-43 was necessary for inclusion of POLDIP3 exon 3. Moreover, we found an increment of POLDIP3 variant-2 mRNA in motor cortex, spinal cord and spinal motor neurons collected by laser capture microdissection with ALS. Our results suggest a loss of TDP-43 function in tissues affected with ALS, supporting the hypothesis that a loss of function of TDP-43 underlies the pathogenesis of ALS.',\n",

              "  'Regulation of chromatin structure by site-specific histone H3 methyltransferases. The organization of chromatin into higher-order structures influences chromosome function and epigenetic gene regulation. Higher-order chromatin has been proposed to be nucleated by the covalent modification of histone tails and the subsequent establishment of chromosomal subdomains by non-histone modifier factors. Here we show that human SUV39H1 and murine Suv39h1--mammalian homologues of Drosophila Su(var)3-9 and of Schizosaccharomyces pombe clr4--encode histone H3-specific methyltransferases that selectively methylate lysine 9 of the amino terminus of histone H3 in vitro. We mapped the catalytic motif to the evolutionarily conserved SET domain, which requires adjacent cysteine-rich regions to confer histone methyltransferase activity. Methylation of lysine 9 interferes with phosphorylation of serine 10, but is also influenced by pre-existing modifications in the amino terminus of H3. In vivo, deregulated SUV39H1 or disrupted Suv39h activity modulate H3 serine 10 phosphorylation in native chromatin and induce aberrant mitotic divisions. Our data reveal a functional interdependence of site-specific H3 tail modifications and suggest a dynamic mechanism for the regulation of higher-order chromatin.',\n",
              "  'Expression of TAP73 and DeltaNP73 in malignant gliomas. The p73 gene is able to encode transcriptionaly active TAp73, as well as a dominant-negatively acting DeltaNp73 transcript isoforms. We studied differential expression of these forms in normal brain as well as glial tumors, by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The expression of p73 was low or undetectable in normal brain tissues. Most of the tumors and non-tumor brain tissues also lacked significant expression of p73 in patients with low-grade astrocytomas. In contrast, most high-grade glial tumors displayed strong up-regulation of TAp73, whereas only a few displayed DeltaNp73 expression. These aberrations may reflect the inactivation of retinoblastoma pathway in these tumors which result in the activation of E2F transcription factors, since TAp73 is a known target of E2F1 gene. The study of TAp73 expression in brain tumors may serve as a means to evaluate the retinoblastoma pathway-dependent tumor progression.',\n",
              "  'Chemical and biological evaluation of dipeptidyl boronic acid proteasome inhibitors for use in prodrugs and pro-soft drugs targeting solid tumors. Bortezomib, a dipeptidyl boronic acid and potent inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, is remarkably effective against multiple myeloma (MM) but not against solid tumors. Dose-limiting adverse effects from \"on target\" inhibition of the proteasome in normal cells and tissues appear to be a key obstacle. Achieving efficacy against solid tumors therefore is likely to require making the inhibitor more selective for tumor tissue over normal tissues. The simplest strategy that might provide such tissue specificity would be to employ a tumor specific protease to release an inhibitor from a larger, noninhibitory structure. However, such release would necessarily generate an inhibitor with a free N-terminal amino group, raising a key question: Can short peptide boronic acids with N-terminal amino groups have the requisite properties to serve as warheads in prodrugs? Here we show that dipeptides of boroLeu, the smallest plausible candidates for the task, can indeed be sufficiently potent, cell-penetrating, cytotoxic, and stable to degradation by cellular peptidases to serve in this capacity.',\n",
              "  'Mepolizumab and exacerbations of refractory eosinophilic asthma. BACKGROUND: Exacerbations of asthma are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and with considerable use of health care resources. Preventing exacerbations remains an important goal of therapy. There is evidence that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway is associated with the risk of exacerbations. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 61 subjects who had refractory eosinophilic asthma and a history of recurrent severe exacerbations. Subjects received infusions of either mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (29 subjects), or placebo (32) at monthly intervals for 1 year. The primary outcome measure was the number of severe exacerbations per subject during the 50-week treatment phase. Secondary outcomes included a change in asthma symptoms, scores on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ, in which scores range from 1 to 7, with lower values indicating more severe impairment and a change of 0.5 unit considered to be clinically important), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) after use of a bronchodilator, airway hyperresponsiveness, and eosinophil counts in the blood and sputum. RESULTS: Mepolizumab was associated with significantly fewer severe exacerbations than placebo over the course of 50 weeks (2.0 vs. 3.4 mean exacerbations per subject; relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.92; P=0.02) and with a significant improvement in the score on the AQLQ (mean increase from baseline, 0.55 vs. 0.19; mean difference between groups, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.62; P=0.02). Mepolizumab significantly lowered eosinophil counts in the blood (P<0.001) and sputum (P=0.002). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to symptoms, FEV(1) after bronchodilator use, or airway hyperresponsiveness. The only serious adverse events reported were hospitalizations for acute severe asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Mepolizumab therapy reduces exacerbations and improves AQLQ scores in patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma. The results of our study suggest that eosinophils have a role as important effector cells in the pathogenesis of severe exacerbations of asthma in this patient population.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether naloxone administered i.v. to out-of-hospital patients with suspected opioid overdose would have a more rapid therapeutic onset than naloxone given subcutaneously (s.q.). METHODS: A prospective, sequential, observational cohort study of 196 consecutive patients with suspected opioid overdose was conducted in an urban out-of-hospital setting, comparing time intervals from arrival at the patient's side to development of a respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min, and durations of bag-valve-mask ventilation. Subjects received either naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. (n = 74) or naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. (n = 122), for respiratory depression of <10 breaths/min. RESULTS: Mean interval from crew arrival to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min was 9.3 +/- 4.2 min for the i.v. group vs 9.6 +/- 4.58 min for the s.q. group (95% CI of the difference -1.55, 1.00). Mean duration of bag-valve-mask ventilation was 8.1 +/- 6.0 min for the i.v. group vs 9.1 +/- 4.8 min for the s.q. group. Cost of materials for administering naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. was $12.30/patient, compared with $10.70/patient for naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. CONCLUSION: There was no clinical difference in the time interval to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min between naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. and naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. for the out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected opioid overdose. The slower rate of absorption via the s.q. route was offset by the delay in establishing an i.v.\",\n",
              "  'Differential effects of diverse p53 isoforms on TAp73 transcriptional activity and apoptosis. The p53 activities are due, at least in part, to its ability to form oligomers that bind to specific DNA sequences and activate transcription. Since some mutant p53 proteins and ΔNp73 isoforms form heterocomplexes with TAp73, we asked whether p53 isoforms can do the same and potentially act as dominant-negative inhibitors of TAp73. Moreover, it has already been found that some isoforms form complex with wtp53 and some of them inhibit p53 tumor-suppressor functions. Therefore, we studied the complex formation and co-immunoprecipitation assays show that all six p53 isoforms examined can form complexes with TAp73β, whereas only Δ133p53α/β/γ isoforms form complex with TAp73α. All p53 isoforms counteract TAp73β transactivation function but with different efficiency and in a promoter-dependent manner. Furthermore, apoptotic activity of TAp73β was augmented by coexpression of p53β, whereas Δ133p53α and β inhibit its apoptotic activity most efficiently. We have determined the half-life of different p53 isoforms: p53γ isoform has the shortest half-life, whereas Δ133p53γ has the longest half-life. Inhibitory interactions of two proteins in complex often lead to their stabilization. However, only three isoforms (Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β and Δ40p53α) stabilize TAp73β. We are convinced that defining the interactions between p53/p73 would give a new insight into how the p53 isoforms modulate the p73 functions in tumorigenesis.',\n",
              "  'X inactive-specific transcript (Xist) expression and X chromosome inactivation in the preattachment bovine embryo. Expression of the X inactive-specific transcript (Xist) is thought to be essential for the initiation of X chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation during female embryo development. In the present study, we analyzed the patterns of Xist transcription and the onset of X chromosome inactivation in bovine preattachment embryos. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed the presence of Xist transcripts in all adult female somatic tissues evaluated. In contrast, among the male tissues examined, Xist expression was detected only in testis. No evidence for Xist transcription was observed after a single round of RT-PCR from pools of in vitro-derived embryos at the 2- to 4-cell stage. Xist transcripts were detected as a faint amplicon at the 8-cell stage initially, and consistently thereafter in all stages examined up to and including the expanded blastocyst stage. Xist transcripts, however, were subsequently detected from the 2-cell stage onward after nested RT-PCR. Preferential [3H]thymidine labeling indicative of late replication of one of the X chromosomes was noted in female embryos of different developmental ages as follows: 2 of 7 (28.5%) early blastocysts, 6 of 13 (46.1%) blastocysts, 8 of 11 (72.1%) expanded blastocysts, and 14 of 17 (77.7%) hatched blastocysts. These results suggest that Xist expression precedes the onset of late replication in the bovine embryo, in a pattern compatible with a possible role of bovine Xist in the initiation of X chromosome inactivation.',\n",
              "  \"p73 expression is regulated by RNPC1, a target of the p53 family, via mRNA stability. p73, a p53 family tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. Due to the role of p73 in tumor suppression and neural development, its expression and activity are tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, including transcription and posttranslational modifications. Here, we found that p73 mRNA stability is regulated by RNPC1, an RNA binding protein and a target of the p53 family. We also showed that a CU-rich element in the 3' untranslated region of p73 is recognized by and responsive to RNPC1. To explore the physiological significance of RNPC1-regulated p73 expression, we showed that the loss of RNPC1 in p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to reduced expression of p73, along with decreased expression of p21, p130, and γ-H2A.X, and consequently a decreased number of senescent cells. Furthermore, we observed that knockdown of TAp73 or p21, another target of RNPC1, attenuates the inhibitory effect of RNPC1 on cell proliferation and premature senescence, whereas combined knockdown of TAp73 and p21 completely abolishes it. Due to the fact that RNPC1 is a target of p73, the mutual regulation between p73 and RNPC1 constitutes a novel feed-forward loop, which might be explored as a target for tumors without a functional p53.\",\n",
              "  'Light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) and its supramolecular organization in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. LHCII is the most abundant membrane protein on earth. It participates in the first steps of photosynthesis by harvesting sunlight and transferring excitation energy to the core complex. Here we have analyzed the LHCII complex of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its association with the core of Photosystem II (PSII) to form multiprotein complexes. Several PSII supercomplexes with different antenna sizes have been purified, the largest of which contains three LHCII trimers (named S, M and N) per monomeric core. A projection map at a 13Å resolution was obtained allowing the reconstruction of the 3D structure of the supercomplex. The position and orientation of the S trimer are the same as in plants; trimer M is rotated by 45° and the additional trimer (named here as LHCII-N), which is taking the position occupied in plants by CP24, is directly associated with the core. The analysis of supercomplexes with different antenna sizes suggests that LhcbM1, LhcbM2/7 and LhcbM3 are the major components of the trimers in the PSII supercomplex, while LhcbM5 is part of the \"extra\" LHCII pool not directly associated with the supercomplex. It is also shown that Chlamydomonas LHCII has a slightly lower Chlorophyll a/b ratio than the complex from plants and a blue shifted absorption spectrum. Finally the data indicate that there are at least six LHCII trimers per dimeric core in the thylakoid membranes, meaning that the antenna size of PSII of C. reinhardtii is larger than that of plants.',\n",

Anticoagulation is recommended for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and/or arterial thromboembolism. The therapeutic arsenal of anticoagulants available to clinicians is mainly composed by unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux and oral vitamin K antagonists (VKA) (i.e. warfarin and acenocumarol). These anticoagulants are effective, but they require parenteral administration (UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux) and/or frequent anticoagulant monitoring (intravenous UFH, oral VKA). Novel anticoagulants in clinical testing include orally active direct factor II inhibitors [dabigatran etexilate (BIBR 1048), AZD0837)], parenteral direct factor II inhibitors (flovagatran sodium), orally active direct factor X inhibitors [rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939), apixaban, betrixaban, YM150, DU-176b, LY-517717, GW813893, TAK-442, PD 0348292] and new parenteral FXa inhibitors [idraparinux, idrabiotaparinux (biotinilated idraparinux; SSR 126517), ultra-low-molecular-weight heparins (ULMWH: AVE5026, RO-14)]. These new compounds have the potential to complement heparins and fondaparinux for short-term anticoagulation and/or to replace VKA for long-term anticoagulation in most patients. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been the firsts of the new oral anticoagulants to be licensed for the prevention of VTE after hip and knee replacement surgery. In the present review, we discuss the pharmacology of new anticoagulants, the key points necessary for interpreting the results of studies on VTE prophylaxis and treatment, the results of clinical trials testing these new compounds and their potential advantages and drawbacks over existing therapies.',\n",
              "  'Heme positively regulates the expression of beta-globin at the locus control region via the transcriptional factor Bach1 in erythroid cells. The transcription factor Bach1 heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins to repress Maf recognition element (MARE)-dependent gene expression. The repressor activity of Bach1 is inhibited by the direct binding of heme. To investigate the involvement of Bach1 in the heme-dependent regulation of the expression of the beta-globin gene, mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were cultured with succinylacetone (SA), a specific inhibitor of heme biosynthesis, and the level of beta-globin mRNA was examined. A marked decrease of beta-globin mRNA in SA-treated cells was observed, and this decrease was reversed by the addition of hemin. An iron chelator, desferrioxamine, also lowered the level of beta-globin mRNA. The heme-dependent expression of beta-globin is a transcriptional event since the expression of the human beta-globin gene promoter-reporter gene containing the microlocus control region (microLCR) was inhibited when human erythroleukemia K562 cells and MEL cells were cultured with SA. Hemin treatment restored the decrease in promoter activity caused by SA. The control of the microLCR-beta-globin promoter reporter gene by heme was dependent on DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 (HS2), which contains MARE. The MARE binding activity of Bach1 in K562 and MEL cells increased upon SA treatment, and the increase was diminished by the treatment with hemin. Transient expression of Bach1 suppressed the microLCR activity, and this repressor activity was cancelled by treatment with hemin. The expression of a mutated Bach1 lacking heme-binding sites led to a loss in the heme responsiveness of the microLCR. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Bach1 bound to the MARE of HS2 increased by the treatment of MEL cells with SA, and this was cancelled by hemin. We propose that heme positively regulates the beta-globin gene expression by blocking the interaction of Bach1 with the MARE in the LCR.',\n",
              "  'Structural insight into maintenance methylation by mouse DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1). Methylation of cytosine in DNA plays a crucial role in development through inheritable gene silencing. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is responsible for the propagation of methylation patterns to the next generation via its preferential methylation of hemimethylated CpG sites in the genome; however, how Dnmt1 maintains methylation patterns is not fully understood. Here we report the crystal structure of the large fragment (291-1620) of mouse Dnmt1 and its complexes with cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine and its product S-adenosyl-L-homocystein. Notably, in the absence of DNA, the N-terminal domain responsible for targeting Dnmt1 to replication foci is inserted into the DNA-binding pocket, indicating that this domain must be removed for methylation to occur. Upon binding of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the catalytic cysteine residue undergoes a conformation transition to a catalytically competent position. For the recognition of hemimethylated DNA, Dnmt1 is expected to utilize a target recognition domain that overhangs the putative DNA-binding pocket. Taking into considerations the recent report of a shorter fragment structure of Dnmt1 that the CXXC motif positions itself in the catalytic pocket and prevents aberrant de novo methylation, we propose that maintenance methylation is a multistep process accompanied by structural changes.',\n",

Activating germline RET mutations are presented in patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B, whereas inactivating germline mutations in patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). The aim of this study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations of the frequently discussed Tyr791Phe mutation in exon 13 of the RET proto-oncogene. Screening of three groups of patients was performed (276 families with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 122 families with HSCR, and 29 patients with pheochromocytoma). We found this mutation in 3 families with apparently sporadic MTC, 3 families with FMTC/MEN2, 1 patient with pheochromocytoma, and 3 families with HSCR. All gene mutation carriers have a silent polymorphism Leu769Leu in exon 13. In three families second germline mutations were detected: Cys620Phe (exon 10) in MEN2A family, Met918Thr (exon 16) in MEN2B family, and Ser649Leu (exon 11) in HSCR patient. Detection of the Tyr791Phe mutation in MEN2/MTC and also in HSCR families leads to the question whether this mutation has a dual character (gain-of-function as well as loss-of-function). A rare case of malignant pheochromocytoma in a patient with the Tyr791Phe mutation is presented.

              "  'Characterization of cancer stem cells in chronic myeloid leukaemia. CML (chronic myeloid leukaemia) is a myeloproliferative disease that originates in an HSC (haemopoietic stem cell) as a result of the t(9;22) translocation, giving rise to the Ph (Philadelphia chromosome) and bcr-abl oncoprotein. The disease starts in CP (chronic phase), but as a result of genomic instability, it progresses over time to accelerated phase and then to BC (blast crisis), becoming increasingly resistant to therapy. bcr-abl is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that has been targeted by TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), including IM (imatinib mesylate), nilotinib and dasatinib. We have developed various flow cytometry techniques to enable us to isolate candidate CML stem cells from CP patients at diagnosis that efflux Hoechst dye, express CD34, lack CD38 and are cytokine-non-responsive in culture over periods of up to 12 days in growth factors. These stem cells have been shown to regenerate bcr-abl-positive haemopoiesis in immunocompromised mice upon transplantation. We previously demonstrated that IM was antiproliferative for CML stem cells but did not induce apoptosis. Clinical experience now confirms that IM may not target CML stem cells in vivo with few patients achieving complete molecular remission and relapse occurring rapidly upon drug withdrawal. Our recent efforts have focused on understanding why CML stem cells are resistant to IM and on trying to find novel ways to induce apoptosis of this population. We have shown that CML stem cells express very high levels of functional wild-type bcr-abl; no kinase domain mutations have been detected in the stem cell population. Dasatinib, a more potent multitargeted TKI than IM, inhibits bcr-abl activity more efficiently than IM but still does not induce apoptosis of the stem cell population. Most recently, we have tested a number of novel drug combinations and found that FTIs (farnesyl transferase inhibitors) have activity against CML. BMS-214662 is the most effective of these and induces apoptosis of phenotypically and functionally defined CML stem cells in vitro, as a single agent and in combination with IM or dasatinib. The effect against CML stem cells is selective with little effect on normal stem cells. The drug is also effective against BC CML stem cells and equally effective against wild-type and mutant bcr-abl, including the most resistant mutant T315I. In association with apoptosis, there is activation of caspase 8 and caspase 3, inhibition of the MAPK pathway, IAP-1 (inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1), NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase). Furthermore, BMS-214662 synergizes with MEK1/2 [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) kinase 1/2] inhibitors, suggesting a second mechanism other that RAS inhibition for induction of apoptosis. Our intentions are now to explore the activity of BMS-214662 in other cancer stem cell disorders and to move this preclinical work to a clinical trial combining dasatinib with BMS-214662 in CML.',\n",
              "  'Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α induces lysosomal biogenesis in brain cells: implications for lysosomal storage disorders. Lysosomes are ubiquitous membrane-enclosed organelles filled with an acidic interior and are central to the autophagic, endocytic, or phagocytic pathway. In contrast to its classical function as the waste management machinery, lysosomes are now considered to be an integral part of various cellular signaling processes. The diverse functionality of this single organelle requires a very complex and coordinated regulation of its activity with transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, at its core. However, mechanisms by which TFEB is regulated are poorly understood. This study demonstrates that gemfibrozil, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, alone and in conjunction with all-trans-retinoic acid is capable of enhancing TFEB in brain cells. We also observed that PPARα, but not PPARβ and PPARγ, is involved in gemfibrozil-mediated up-regulation of TFEB. Reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies confirmed the recruitment of retinoid X receptor α, PPARα, and PGC1α on the PPAR-binding site on the Tfeb promoter as well. Subsequently, the drug-mediated induction of TFEB caused an increase in lysosomal protein and the lysosomal abundance in cell. Collectively, this study reinforces the link between lysosomal biogenesis and lipid metabolism with TFEB at the crossroads. Furthermore, gemfibrozil may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders in which autophagy-lysosome pathway plays an important role.',\n",

CONCLUSION: Closely packed neurofilaments in giant axons are common pathological changes in Chinese patients with GAN, whereas irregular tubular-like structures appear in the classical type of this neuropathy.',\n",
              "  'Familial isolated pituitary adenoma: evidence for genetic heterogeneity. The identification of mutations in the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene in a subset of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) cases has recently expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited pituitary adenoma disorders. However, a genetic cause of has not yet been determined in the majority (85%) of FIPA families and half of the families with isolated familial somatotropinoma. Several studies and reviews have assessed the genetic and clinical features of AIP-mutated FIPA patients, which range from a complete lack of symptoms in adult/elderly individuals to large, aggressive early-onset pituitary tumors. In this study, we aimed to briefly revise the data available for the 11q13 locus and other additional loci that have been implicated in genetic susceptibility to FIPA: 2p16-12; 3q28; 4q32.3-4q33; chr 5, 8q12.1, chr 14, 19q13.4 and 21q22.1. These candidate regions may contain unidentified gene(s) that can be potentially disrupted in AIP-negative FIPA families. A better knowledge of these susceptibility loci may disclose modifier genes that are likely to play exacerbating or protective roles in the phenotypic diversity of AIP-mutated families.',\n",
              "  'Advances in understanding chromosome silencing by the long non-coding RNA Xist. In female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes becomes genetically silenced to compensate for dosage imbalance of X-linked genes between XX females and XY males. X chromosome inactivation (X-inactivation) is a classical model for epigenetic gene regulation in mammals and has been studied for half a century. In the last two decades, efforts have been focused on the X inactive-specific transcript (Xist) locus, discovered to be the master regulator of X-inactivation. The Xist gene produces a non-coding RNA that functions as the primary switch for X-inactivation, coating the X chromosome from which it is transcribed in cis. Significant progress has been made towards understanding how Xist is regulated at the onset of X-inactivation, but our understanding of the molecular basis of silencing mediated by Xist RNA has progressed more slowly. A picture has, however, begun to emerge, and new tools and resources hold out the promise of further advances to come. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of our knowledge, what is known about Xist RNA and how it may trigger chromosome silencing.',\n",
              "  'Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal. BACKGROUND: Specific reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are lacking. Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. METHODS: We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after the administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the determination at a central laboratory of the dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time. A key secondary end point was the restoration of hemostasis. RESULTS: This interim analysis included 90 patients who received idarucizumab (51 patients in group A and 39 in group B). Among 68 patients with an elevated dilute thrombin time and 81 with an elevated ecarin clotting time at baseline, the median maximum percentage reversal was 100% (95% confidence interval, 100 to 100). Idarucizumab normalized the test results in 88 to 98% of the patients, an effect that was evident within minutes. Concentrations of unbound dabigatran remained below 20 ng per milliliter at 24 hours in 79% of the patients. Among 35 patients in group A who could be assessed, hemostasis, as determined by local investigators, was restored at a median of 11.4 hours. Among 36 patients in group B who underwent a procedure, normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported in 33, and mildly or moderately abnormal hemostasis was reported in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after idarucizumab administration in a patient in whom anticoagulants had not been reinitiated. CONCLUSIONS: Idarucizumab completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within minutes. (Funded by Boehringer Ingelheim; RE-VERSE AD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02104947.).',\n",
              "  'LepChorionDB, a database of Lepidopteran chorion proteins and a set of tools useful for the identification of chorion proteins in Lepidopteran proteomes. Chorion proteins of Lepidoptera have a tripartite structure, which consists of a central domain and two, more variable, flanking arms. The central domain is highly conserved and it is used for the classification of chorion proteins into two major classes, A and B. Annotated and unreviewed Lepidopteran chorion protein sequences are available in various databases. A database, named LepChorionDB, was constructed by searching 5 different protein databases using class A and B central domain-specific profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs), developed in this work. A total of 413 Lepidopteran chorion proteins from 9 moths and 1 butterfly species were retrieved. These data were enriched and organised in order to populate LepChorionDB, the first relational database, available on the web, containing Lepidopteran chorion proteins grouped in A and B classes. LepChorionDB may provide insights in future functional and evolutionary studies of Lepidopteran chorion proteins and thus, it will be a useful tool for the Lepidopteran scientific community and Lepidopteran genome annotators, since it also provides access to the two pHMMs developed in this work, which may be used to discriminate A and B class chorion proteins. LepChorionDB is freely available at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/LepChorionDB.',\n",
              "  \"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) function is important to the development and expansion of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by constitutive activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, but variable responsiveness of the BCR to antigen ligation. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL. Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL. To determine the role of BTK in CLL, we used patient samples and the Eμ-TCL1 (TCL1) transgenic mouse model of CLL, which results in spontaneous leukemia development. Inhibition of BTK in primary human CLL cells by small interfering RNA promotes apoptosis. Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib. Collectively, our data confirm the importance of kinase-functional BTK in CLL.\",\n",

Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSP) biology and neurogenesis in adult central nervous system (CNS) are important both towards potential future therapeutic applications for CNS repair, and for the fundamental function of the CNS. In the present study, we report the characterization of NSP population from subventricular zone (SVZ) of neonatal piglet brain using in vivo and in vitro systems. We show that the nestin and vimentin-positive neural progenitor cells are present in the SVZ of the lateral ventricles of neonatal piglet brain. In vitro, piglet NSPs proliferated as neurospheres, expressed the typical protein of neural progenitors, nestin and a range of well-established neurodevelopmental markers. Upon dissociation and subculture, piglet NSPs differentiated into neurons and glial cells. Clonal analysis demonstrates that piglet NSPs are multipotent and retain the capacity to generate both glia and neurons. These cells expressed VEGF, VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and Neuropilin-1 and -2 mRNAs. Real time PCR revealed that SVZ NSPs from newborn piglet expressed total VEGF and all VEGF splice variants. These findings show that piglet NSPs may be helpful to more effectively design growth factor based strategies to enhance endogenous precursor cells for cell transplantation studies potentially leading to the application of this strategy in the nervous system disease and injury.',\n",
              "  'The specific Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor SEA0400 prevents nitric oxide-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays a role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, causes apoptotic-like cell death in cultured glial cells via NCX-mediated pathways and the mechanism for NO-induced cytotoxicity is cell type-dependent. The present study examined using the specific NCX inhibitor 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) whether NCX is involved in NO-induced injury in cultured neuronal cells. The treatment of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with SNP resulted in apoptosis and the cytotoxicity was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase inhibitor U0126 and the p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580, but not by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP60012. SNP increased Ca(2+) influx and intracellular Ca(2+) levels. In addition, SNP increased ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These effects of SNP were prevented by SEA0400. SNP-induced cytotoxicity was not affected by inhibitors of the Ca(2+), Na(+) and store-operated/capacitative channels. Moreover, SNP-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels, ROS production and decrease in cell viability were blocked by a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor. These results suggest that Ca(2+) influx via the reverse of NCX is involved in the cascade of NO-induced neuronal apoptosis and NO activates the NCX through guanylate cyclase/PKG pathway.',\n",
              "  \"The PD-1/PD-L1 axis modulates the natural killer cell versus multiple myeloma effect: a therapeutic target for CT-011, a novel monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody. T-cell expression of programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) down-regulates the immune response against malignancy by interacting with cognate ligands (eg, PD-L1) on tumor cells; however, little is known regarding PD-1 and natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells exert cytotoxicity against multiple myeloma (MM), an effect enhanced through novel therapies. We show that NK cells from MM patients express PD-1 whereas normal NK cells do not and confirm PD-L1 on primary MM cells. Engagement of PD-1 with PD-L1 should down-modulate the NK-cell versus MM effect. We demonstrate that CT-011, a novel anti-PD-1 antibody, enhances human NK-cell function against autologous, primary MM cells, seemingly through effects on NK-cell trafficking, immune complex formation with MM cells, and cytotoxicity specifically toward PD-L1(+) MM tumor cells but not normal cells. We show that lenalidomide down-regulates PD-L1 on primary MM cells and may augment CT-011's enhancement of NK-cell function against MM. We demonstrate a role for the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis in the NK-cell immune response against MM and a role for CT-011 in enhancing the NK-cell versus MM effect. A phase 2 clinical trial of CT-011 in combination with lenalidomide for patients with MM should be considered.\",\n",
              "  'Maintenance DNA methyltransferase (Met1) and silencing of CpG-methylated foreign DNA in Volvox carteri. DNA methylation plays an important role in the gene-silencing network of higher eukaryotes. We have analyzed the 21.5-kb maintenance methyltransferase (M-MTase) gene, met1, of the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri. The met1 transcript was detected only during the period when DNA replication and cell division are taking place. It encodes a 238 kDa protein containing eight C-terminal activity domains typical of M-MTases, plus upstream DNA-binding domains including the ProDom domain PD003757, which experimental analyses in animal systems have indicated is required for targeting the enzyme to DNA-replication foci. Several insertions of unknown function make Volvox Met1 the largest known member of the Met1/Dnmt1 family. Here we also show that several endogenous transposon families are CpG-methylated in Volvox, which we think causes them to be inactive. This view is supported by the observation that an in vitro CpG-methylated gene introduced into Volvox was maintained in the methylated and silent state over >100 generations. Thus, we believe that Met1 recognizes and perpetuates the in vitro methylation signal, and that the silencing machinery is then able to transduce such a methylation-only signal into a stable heterochromatic (and silent) state.',\n",
              "  'Crystal structure of the human OX2 orexin receptor bound to the insomnia drug suvorexant. The orexin (also known as hypocretin) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) respond to orexin neuropeptides in the central nervous system to regulate sleep and other behavioural functions in humans. Defects in orexin signalling are responsible for the human diseases of narcolepsy and cataplexy; inhibition of orexin receptors is an effective therapy for insomnia. The human OX2 receptor (OX2R) belongs to the β branch of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, and can bind to diverse compounds including the native agonist peptides orexin-A and orexin-B and the potent therapeutic inhibitor suvorexant. Here, using lipid-mediated crystallization and protein engineering with a novel fusion chimaera, we solved the structure of the human OX2R bound to suvorexant at 2.5\\xa0Å resolution. The structure reveals how suvorexant adopts a π-stacked horseshoe-like conformation and binds to the receptor deep in the orthosteric pocket, stabilizing a network of extracellular salt bridges and blocking transmembrane helix motions necessary for activation. Computational docking suggests how other classes of synthetic antagonists may interact with the receptor at a similar position in an analogous π-stacked fashion. Elucidation of the molecular architecture of the human OX2R expands our understanding of peptidergic GPCR ligand recognition and will aid further efforts to modulate orexin signalling for therapeutic ends.',\n",
              "  'SERCA in genesis of arrhythmias: what we already know and what is new? This review mainly focuses on the structure, function of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) and its role in genesis of arrhythmias. SERCA is a membrane protein that belongs to the family of P-type ion translocating ATPases and pumps free cytosolic calcium into intracellular stores. Active transport of Ca2+ is achieved, according to the E1-E2 model, changing of SERCA structure by Ca2+. The affinity of Ca2+ -binding sites varies from high (E1) to low (E2). Three different SERCA genes were identified-SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3. SERCA is mainly represented by the SERCA2a isoform in the heart. In heart muscle, during systole, depolarization triggers the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and starts contraction. During diastole, muscle relaxation occurs as Ca2+ is again removed from cytosol, predominantly by accumulation into SR via the action of SERCA2a. The main regulator of SERCA2a is phospholamban and another regulator proteolipid of SERCA is sarcolipin. There are a lot of studies on the effect of decreased and/or increased SERCA activity in genesis of arrhythmia. Actually both decrease and increase of SERCA activity in the heart result in some pathological mechanisms such as heart failure and arrhythmia.',\n",
              "  'Evaluation of the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor - betrixaban. INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therapy for treatment and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The emergence of two new classes of orally administered anticoagulants, direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape in the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between betrixaban and currently available novel anticoagulants and future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acute coronary syndromes is yet to be defined based on clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currently, there are no specific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants. The availability of an effective reversal agent would be very attractive for the management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or the need for emergent surgery.',\n",
              "  'Kallikrein-related peptidases: bridges between immune functions and extracellular matrix degradation. Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) constitute a family of 15 highly conserved serine proteases encoded by the largest uninterrupted cluster of protease-encoding genes within the human genome. Recent studies, mostly relying on in vitro proteolysis of recombinant proteins, have suggested that KLK activities are regulated by proteolytic activation cascades that can operate in a tissue-specific manner, such as the semen liquefaction and skin desquamation cascades. The validity of KLK activation cascades in vivo largely remains to be demonstrated. Here, we focus on recent investigations showing that KLKs represent interesting players in the broader field of immunology based on their ability to bridge their inherent ability to degrade the extracellular matrix with major functions of the immune system. More specifically, KLKs assist in the infiltration of immune cells through the skin and the blood brain barrier, whereas they catalyze the generation of antimicrobial peptides by proteolytic activation and further processing of protein precursors. In an attempt to integrate current knowledge, we propose KLK-mediated pathways that are putatively involved in inflammation associated with skin wounding and central nervous system disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Finally, we present evidence of KLK participation in autoimmune diseases and allergies.',\n",
              "  'Thyroid anomalies in Williams syndrome: investigation of 95 patients. Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration; in one of the two reports, 70% of the patients demonstrated a hypoplasia of thyroid gland as well. In our institution, we currently follow a large population of WS patients who periodically undergo a multispecialist clinical evaluation that includes ultrasound evaluation of the thyroid gland, and levels of FT3, FT4, TSH, and anti-thyroid antibodies. Here, we report on the prevalence of thyroid structural and functional anomalies, in a population of 95 WS patients, half of them followed for more than 5 years. Our study confirms the increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample) and thyroid gland hypoplasia (74.7%). Moreover, we demonstrated that TSH elevation declines with age. For this reason, we suggest that a complete thyroid evaluation be performed in every patient with WS, and that this medical complication should be periodically searched for in follow-up visits.',\n",
              "  '[Phenotypic evaluation of patients with Pendred syndrome]. INTRODUCTION: The Pendred syndrome (PS) is an autosomally recessively inherited disease. Its diagnosis requires identification of the classical triad of symptoms, including hypoacusis, thyroid goitre and iodine organification defect in the thyroid, which may lead to thyroid functional disorders of hypothyroidism. SP is accompanied by anatomical anomalies. The objective is the hearing and balance system evaluation and the analysis of the inner ear structure and also the assessment of the function and structure of thyroid gland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the research four families were qualified, 7 persons with PS, 12 persons altogether. In all the patients the anamnesis in the form of a questionnaire and laryngological examination were performed. It was followed by pure tone, speech and impedance audiometry and brainstem response testing as well. ENG was also conducted. Patients with hearing loss were subjected to magnetic resonance of temporal bone. For the whole group thyroid hormones levels and iodine organification in the thyroid identified in a test with potassium perchlorate were measured and also USG and scyntography were conducted. RESULTS: In audiological examination in 3 cases deafness, in 2 cases profound hypoacusis and in 2 mild hypoacusis were recognised. In the group in 2 patients the hypoacusis was of a mixed type. In radiological assessment the labirynth showed anatomical anomalies in the form of enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct and the endolyphatic sac, yet in 3 patients the anomalies also concerned the structure of cochlear and semicircular canals. Endocrine examination showed hypothyroidism in 5, its subclinical form in 1, diffuse thyroid goitre in 4 and nodular thyroid goiter in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: A complex clinical evaluation: endocrine and audiological, together with radiological diagnostic imaging, supported by molecular studies of SLC26A4 gene, are the procedures, necessary for complete and accurate diagnosis of PS and EVAS.',\n",
              "  \"Tripolin A, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of aurora A kinase, reveals new regulation of HURP's distribution on microtubules. Mitotic regulators exhibiting gain of function in tumor cells are considered useful cancer therapeutic targets for the development of small-molecule inhibitors. The human Aurora kinases are a family of such targets. In this study, from a panel of 105 potential small-molecule inhibitors, two compounds Tripolin A and Tripolin B, inhibited Aurora A kinase activity in vitro. In human cells however, only Tripolin A acted as an Aurora A inhibitor. We combined in vitro, in vivo single cell and in silico studies to demonstrate the biological action of Tripolin A, a non-ATP competitive inhibitor. Tripolin A reduced the localization of pAurora A on spindle microtubules (MTs), affected centrosome integrity, spindle formation and length, as well as MT dynamics in interphase, consistent with Aurora A inhibition by RNAi or other specific inhibitors, such as MLN8054 or MLN8237. Interestingly, Tripolin A affected the gradient distribution towards the chromosomes, but not the MT binding of HURP (Hepatoma Up-Regulated Protein), a MT-associated protein (MAP) and substrate of the Aurora A kinase. Therefore Tripolin A reveals a new way of regulating mitotic MT stabilizers through Aurora A phosphorylation. Tripolin A is predicted to bind Aurora A similarly but not identical to MLN8054, therefore it could be used to dissect pathways orchestrated by Aurora kinases as well as a scaffold for further inhibitor development.\",\n",
              "  'Alternative polyadenylation sites reveal distinct chromatin accessibility and histone modification in human cell lines. MOTIVATION: In addition to alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation has also been identified as a critical and prevalent regulatory mechanism in human gene expression. However, the mechanism of alternative polyadenylation selection and the involved factors is still largely unknown. RESULTS: We use the ENCODE data to scan DNA functional elements, including chromatin accessibility and histone modification, around transcript cleavage sites. Our results demonstrate that polyadenylation sites tend to be less sensitive to DNase I. However, these polyadenylation sites have preference in nucleosome-depleted regions, indicating the involvement of chromatin higher-order structure rather than nucleosomes in the resultant lower chromatin accessibility. More interestingly, for genes using two polyadenylation sites, the distal sites show even lower chromatin accessibility compared with the proximal sites or the unique sites of genes using only one polyadenylation site. We also observe that the histone modification mark, histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the cleavage sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from those of genes using a single polyadenylation site. Surprisingly, the H3K36Me3 levels are comparable among the alternative polyadenylation sites themselves. In summary, polyadenylation and alternative polyadenylation are closely related to functional elements on the DNA level. CONTACT: liang.chen@usc.edu.',\n",
              "  'The impact of clonal evolution on response to imatinib mesylate (STI571) in accelerated phase CML. In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the development of chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome (clonal evolution) is considered by many to be a feature of accelerated phase (AP). Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a selective inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, has significant activity in AP CML. As clonal evolution could allow Bcr-Abl independent proliferation, we analyzed its impact on the outcome of 71 AP patients treated with 600 mg of imatinib mesylate. Fifteen patients had clonal evolution alone (AP-CE), 32 had AP features but no evidence of clonal evolution (HEM-AP), and 24 had AP features plus clonal evolution (HEM-AP + CE). Of the AP-CE patients, 73% had a major cytogenetic response, compared with 31% of the HEM-AP patients (P =.043) and 12.5% of the HEM-AP + CE patients (P =.007). Complete cytogenetic responses were seen in 60% of AP-CE patients, compared with 31% of HEM-AP patients (P =.19) and 8% of HEM-AP + CE patients (P <.001). With mean follow-up of 11.2 months, 35% of all patients failed treatment. The lowest estimated rate of treatment failure at 1 year, 0%, was seen in AP-CE patients, compared with rates of 31% for HEM-AP patients and 69% for HEM-AP + CE patients (P =.0004). After 1 year, 100% of AP-CE patients were still alive, compared with 85% of HEM-AP patients and 67.5% of HEM-AP + CE patients (P =.01). In conclusion, in patients with clonal evolution as the sole criterion of disease acceleration, good responses to imatinib are still possible. Once patients have other signs of acceleration, clonal evolution predicts lower response rates and a shorter time to treatment failure.',\n",
              "  'Expression of DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalities such as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, developmental abnormality of fin muscle, disorganization of facial musculature and/or degeneration of trunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant localization of myogenic cells marked with α-actin promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside somite boundary, especially in head region. These abnormalities were rescued by coinjection of the short form of DUX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, even at extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FSHD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also propose that DUX4 expression during development is important for the pathogenesis of FSHD.',\n",

              "  'Crystal structure of the receptor binding domain of the botulinum C-D mosaic neurotoxin reveals potential roles of lysines 1118 and 1136 in membrane interactions. The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced by different strains of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum are responsible for the disease botulism and include a group of immunologically distinct serotypes (A, B, E, and F) that are considered to be the most lethal natural proteins known for humans. Two BoNT serotypes, C and D, while rarely associated with human infection, are responsible for deadly botulism outbreaks afflicting animals. Also associated with animal infections is the BoNT C-D mosaic protein (BoNT/CD), a BoNT subtype that is essentially a hybrid of the BoNT/C (∼two-third) and BoNT/D (∼one-third) serotypes. While the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain receptor binding (HCR) domain of BoNT/CD (BoNT/CD-HCR) is very similar to the corresponding amino acid sequence of BoNT/D, BoNT/CD-HCR binds synaptosome membranes better than BoNT/D-HCR. To obtain structural insights for the different membrane binding properties, the crystal structure of BoNT/CD-HCR (S867-E1280) was determined at 1.56 Å resolution and compared to previously reported structures for BoNT/D-HCR. Overall, the BoNT/CD-HCR structure is similar to the two sub-domain organization observed for other BoNT HCRs: an N-terminal jellyroll barrel motif and a C-terminal β-trefoil fold. Comparison of the structure of BoNT/CD-HCR with BoNT/D-HCR indicates that K1118 has a similar structural role as the equivalent residue, E1114, in BoNT/D-HCR, while K1136 has a structurally different role than the equivalent residue, G1132, in BoNT/D-HCR. Lysine-1118 forms a salt bridge with E1247 and may enhance membrane interactions by stabilizing the putative membrane binding loop (K1240-N1248). Lysine-1136 is observed on the surface of the protein. A sulfate ion bound to K1136 may mimic a natural interaction with the negatively changed phospholipid membrane surface. Liposome-binding experiments demonstrate that BoNT/CD-HCR binds phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes more tightly than BoNT/D-HCR.',\n",

Since the beginning of the neuroleptics in 1952, French psychiatrists have proposed a classification of neuroleptics, taking into account the pharmacological and therapeutic differences between these drugs. They distinguished 3 different clinical effects of neuroleptics: sedative effects, effects on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and effects on the negative symptoms. The effect of some neuroleptics on negative symptoms is recognized by the international community, which considers clozapine to be effective. In France, in most cases, the indication of clozapine is still refractory paranoid schizophrenia. The effect of this atypical neuroleptic on other types of schizophrenic patient is not well known. Remoxipride appears to be as effective in treating psychotic symptoms and to have fewer side effects than haloperidol. Remoxipride is effective for both positive and negative symptoms. Loxapine has been prescribed in France since 1980. Its pharmacological profile is close to that of clozapine: it has dopamine (D2), histamine (H1), serotonin (5-HT2) and adrenergic (alpha 1)-blocking activities. Its best indication seems to be paranoid schizophrenia, although some data suggest bipolar action. The bipolar action of some new neuroleptics is illustrated by amisulpride, a substitute benzamide derivative. The originality of this molecule lies in its two opposite actions at two distinct doses. Doses of 600-1200 mg/day are effective against positive symptoms; 50-150 mg/day improves negative symptoms. This latter effect could be mediated by activation of the dopamine system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",
              "  'Clinical phenotype and endocrinological investigations in a patient with a mutation in the MCT8 thyroid hormone transporter. UNLABELLED: Thyroid hormones are known to be essential for growth, development, and metabolism. Recently, the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) was identified as a thyroid hormone transporter, and MCT8 mutations have been associated with Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X linked condition characterized by severe mental retardation, dysarthria, athetoid movements, muscle hypoplasia, and spastic paraplegia. Here we describe in detail the clinical and biochemical features and the response to thyroid hormone (L-thyroxine (LT4)) administration in a boy with an MCT8 mutation (c.1649delA) that truncates the protein in the twelfth transmembrane domain. It is of note that brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed delayed myelination from infancy. Endocrine functions other than thyroid hormone regulation and metabolism were intact, resulting in normal hypothalamic/pituitary function tests. While LT4 administration suppressed thyrotropin (TSH) secretion, no significant changes in thyroid hormone values or clinical symptoms were observed. CONCLUSION: the characteristic thyroid hormone function tests and brain MRI findings may allow screening of high-risk populations for a better understanding of MCT8 pathophysiology.',\n",
              "  'Analysis of the SLC26A4 gene in patients with Pendred syndrome in Taiwan. Pendred syndrome (PS) is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, goiter, and a partial iodine organification defect. In this study, we characterized the thyroid status and identified mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in Chinese subjects with PS. We evaluated 7 unrelated Chinese subjects who had PS. Biochemical analysis, formal audiogram, ultrasonography of the thyroid gland, perchlorate discharge test, computerized tomography scan of the vestibular aqueducts, and DNA sequence analysis of SLC26A4 were performed. Levels of thyroid hormones were essentially normal in all patients: 2 patients had goiters and/or elevated serum thyroglobulin levels, whereas 2 other patients had positive thyroid antibodies and a positive perchlorate discharge test. We identified SLC26A4 gene mutations in 6 of 7 probands and their affected relatives. The affected subjects in family I was compound heterozygous for 2 missense mutations: a mutation in exon 9 (1079C>T) that resulted in the replacement of alanine by valine at codon 360 (A360V) and a mutation in exon 19 (2168A>G) that resulted in the replacement of histidine by arginine at codon 723 (H723R). The affected subjects in families II and III all were homozygous for a mutation in intron 7. The probands IV and V were compound heterozygotes for the mutation in intron 7 and in exon 19, and the proband VI was compound heterozygous for the intron 7 mutation and a missense mutation in exon 12 (1343C>T) that resulted in the replacement of serine by leucine at codon 448 (S448L). One novel mutation was identified (A360V). We identified biallelic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in 6 of 7 probands with PS in Taiwan, including a novel missense mutation. The mild thyroid dysfunction in these patients suggests that PS should be considered in all patients with congenital or early-onset hearing impairment.',\n",
              "  'Rett syndrome: methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 mutations and phenotype-genotype correlations. Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in females, typically after the first year of life. It is a leading cause of mental retardation and autistic behavior in girls and women; a hallmark of the disease is incessant hand movements in the form of wringing, twisting, or clapping. It was recently discovered that RTT is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. MECP2 assists in the transcriptional silencing process via DNA methylation; we hypothesize that disruption of this gene alters the normal developmental expression of various other genes, some of which must account for the peculiar neurologic phenotype of RTT. Molecular studies have identified MECP2 mutations in up to 80% of classic RTT patients; mutation type has some effect on the phenotypic manifestation of RTT, but the pattern of X inactivation seems to determine phenotypic severity. Favorable (skewed) X inactivation can so spare a patient from the effects of mutant MECP2 that they display only the mildest learning disability or no phenotype at all. The unmitigated impact of mutant MECP2 can be inferred from the few males who have been born into RTT kindreds with such severe neonatal encephalopathy that they did not survive their second year. MECP2 mutations thus manifest in a far broader array of phenotypes than classic RTT. This discovery should prove helpful in diagnosing cases of mild learning disability or severe neonatal encephalopathies of unknown cause and also should provide insight into the pathogenesis of RTT.',\n",
              "  'Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of opicapone, a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, in healthy subjects: prediction of slow enzyme-inhibitor complex dissociation of a short-living and very long-acting inhibitor. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opicapone is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (including the effect of food) and pharmacodynamics (effect on COMT activity) following single oral doses of opicapone in young healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Single rising oral doses of opicapone (10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,200 mg) were administered to eight groups of eight subjects per group (two subjects randomized to placebo and six subjects to opicapone), under a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. In an additional group of 12 subjects, a 50 mg single dose of opicapone was administered on two occasions, once having fasted overnight and once with a high-fat high-calorie meal. RESULTS: Opicapone was well tolerated at all doses tested. The extent of systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration) to opicapone and metabolites increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner and showed a decrease following concomitant ingestion of a high-fat high-calorie meal. The apparent terminal elimination half-life of opicapone was 0.8-3.2 h. Sulphation appeared to be the main metabolic pathway for opicapone, and both opicapone and the main sulphated metabolite are likely excreted by the biliary route. Maximum COMT inhibition by opicapone was dose dependent, ranged from 36.1% (10 mg) to 100% (200 mg and above), and reached statistical significance at all doses tested. The long duration of COMT inhibition by opicapone, however, tended to be independent from the dose taken. The observed half-life of opicapone-induced COMT inhibition in human erythrocytes was 61.6 h (standard deviation [SD] = 37.6 h), which reflects an underlying dissociative process with a kinetic rate constant of 3.1 × 10(-6) s(-1) (SD = 1.9 × 10(-6) s(-1)). Such a process compares well to the estimated dissociation rate constant (k(off)) of the COMT-opicapone molecular complex (k(off) = 1.9 × 10(-6) s(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone was well-tolerated and presented dose-proportional kinetics. Opicapone demonstrated marked and sustained inhibition of erythrocyte soluble COMT activity. Based on the observation that the half-life of COMT inhibition is independent of the dose and that it reflects an underlying kinetic process that is consistent with the k(off) value of the COMT-opicapone complex, we propose that the sustained COMT inhibition, far beyond the observable point of clearance of circulating drug, is due to the long residence time of the reversible complex formed between COMT and opicapone. Globally, these promising results provide a basis for further clinical development of opicapone.',\n",
              "  'Hemoprotein Bach1 regulates enhancer availability of heme oxygenase-1 gene. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects cells from various insults including oxidative stress. Transcriptional activators, including the Nrf2/Maf heterodimer, have been the focus of studies on the inducible expression of ho-1. Here we show that a heme-binding factor, Bach1, is a critical physiological repressor of ho-1. Bach1 bound to the multiple Maf recognition elements (MAREs) of ho-1 enhancers with MafK in vitro and repressed their activity in vivo, while heme abrogated this repressor function of Bach1 by inhibiting its binding to the ho-1 enhancers. Gene targeting experiments in mice revealed that, in the absence of Bach1, ho-1 became expressed constitutively at high levels in various tissues under normal physiological conditions. By analyzing bach1/nrf2 compound-deficient mice, we documented antagonistic activities of Bach1 and Nrf2 in several tissues. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that small Maf proteins participate in both repression and activation of ho-1. Thus, regulation of ho-1 involves a direct sensing of heme levels by Bach1 (by analogy to lac repressor sensitivity to lactose), generating a simple feedback loop whereby the substrate effects repressor-activator antagonism.',\n",
              "  'Mutations in the SLC26A4 (pendrin) gene in patients with sensorineural deafness and enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Pendred syndrome and the enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) are considered phenotypic variations of the same entity due to mutations in the SLC26A4 (pendrin) gene. Pendred syndrome consists in sensorineural deafness, goiter and impaired thyroid hormone synthesis while in EVA thyroid function seems to be preserved. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function and morphology and to look for mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in patients presented with EVA. Among 57 consecutive patients with sensorineural deafness 15 with EVA, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were identified and studied. A complete evaluation of thyroid function including thyroid echography and perchlorate discharge test was carried out in all patients with EVA; all exons of the SLC26A4 gene were amplified from peripheral leukocytes and directly sequenced, using specific intronic primers. Out of 15 patients with EVA, goiter was present in 8 (53%), hypothyroidism in 7 (47%), increased serum thyroglobulin levels in 8 (53%) and a positive perchlorate discharge test in 10 (67%). Nine alleles of the SLC26A4 gene were mutated: 2 novel mutations (L465W and G497R) and 4 already known mutations (T410M, R409H, T505N and IVS1001+1G>A) were found. Four subjects were compound heterozygous and 1 heterozygous (G497R/wt). All patients harbouring mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had goiter and a positive perchlorate discharge test: 3 were slightly hypothyroid and 2 euthyroid. The remaining 10 patients had no mutations in the SLC26A4 gene: 4 of them were hypothyroid, 2 with goiter and positive perchlorate discharge test, 2 without goiter and with negative perchlorate discharge test. Two patients without mutations were euthyroid with positive perchlorate discharge test. Patients with mutations in the SLC26A4 gene had larger thyroid volume (p<0.002), higher serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (p<0.002) and greater radioiodine discharge after perchlorate (p=0.09) than patients without mutations. The results of the present study lend support to the concept that all patients with mutated SLC26A4 gene have abnormalities of thyroid function tests.',\n",
              "  'Perturbation of m6A writers reveals two distinct classes of mRNA methylation at internal and 5\\' sites. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a common modification of mRNA with potential roles in fine-tuning the RNA life cycle. Here, we identify a dense network of proteins interacting with METTL3, a component of the methyltransferase complex, and show that three of them (WTAP, METTL14, and KIAA1429) are required for methylation. Monitoring m6A levels upon WTAP depletion allowed the definition of accurate and near single-nucleotide resolution methylation maps and their classification into WTAP-dependent and -independent sites. WTAP-dependent sites are located at internal positions in transcripts, topologically static across a variety of systems we surveyed, and inversely correlated with mRNA stability, consistent with a role in establishing \"basal\" degradation rates. WTAP-independent sites form at the first transcribed base as part of the cap structure and are present at thousands of sites, forming a previously unappreciated layer of transcriptome complexity. Our data shed light on the proteomic and transcriptional underpinnings of this RNA modification.',\n",
              "  'Immunolocalization of DNMT1 and DNMT3a in salivary gland neoplasms. OBJECTIVE: Salivary gland neoplasms pathogenesis has not been well established. DNA methylation occurs when methyl groups are added to cytosine nucleotides in specific areas of the gene by the enzyme DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). This chemical modification can alter gene expression without altering DNA sequence. While DNMT3a is mostly involved in de novo methylation, DNMT1 acts as a maintenance methyltransferase. We aimed to investigate the immunoexpression of DNMT3a and DNMT1 in minor salivary gland neoplasms, comparing it with normal tissue. MATERIAL: Forty-four formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of pleomorphic adenoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma were included in the study. The DNMT1 and DNMT3a proteins were identified by using a highly sensitive polymer-based system. RESULTS: Positive nuclear and cytoplasmic labeling for DNMT1 was observed in all samples, including the controls. Positive nuclear labeling for DNMT3a was found only in few neoplasms: 1 pleomorphic adenoma (9.0%), 2 adenoid cystic carcinoma (16.6%) and 1 mucoepidermoid (9.0%) cases. CONCLUSION: Our results were not able to demonstrate a clear correlation between DNMT1 and DNMT3a immunoexpression and salivary gland neoplasms development.',\n",
              "  'Empagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. INTRODUCTION: Despite the availability of numerous anti-diabetes drugs and treatment guidelines, many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) do not reach recommended targets for glycemic control. There remains an unmet need for effective and well-tolerated anti-diabetes agents that can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies to improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of treatment for T2DM that reduce hyperglycemia by reducing renal glucose reabsorption and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. AREAS COVERED: This paper reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin , the results of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of empagliflozin given as monotherapy or as add-on therapy on glycemic control, body weight, and blood pressure in patients with T2DM, and the safety and tolerability profile of empagliflozin. EXPERT OPINION: Empagliflozin offers good glycemic efficacy, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and a low risk of hypoglycemia. These attributes, coupled with the ability to be used in virtually any combination with other anti-diabetes agents and at any stage in the disease process, provide a welcome new agent to our armamentarium of drugs to help manage T2DM.',\n",

The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected ingestion of dextromethorphan by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of dextromethorphan might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of dextromethorphan ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to the ingestion of dextromethorphan alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) Patients who exhibit more than mild effects (e.g., infrequent vomiting or somnolence [lightly sedated and arousable with speaking voice or light touch]) after an acute dextromethorphan ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 3) Patients who have ingested 5-7.5 mg/kg should receive poison center-initiated follow-up approximately every 2 hours for up to 4 hours after ingestion. Refer to an emergency department if more than mild symptoms develop (Grade D). 4) Patients who have ingested more than 7.5 mg/kg should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 5) If the patient is taking other medications likely to interact with dextromethorphan and cause serotonin syndrome, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, poison center-initiated follow-up every 2 hours for 8 hours is recommended (Grade D). 6) Patients who are asymptomatic and more than 4 hours have elapsed since the time of ingestion can be observed at home (Grade C). 7) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 8) Do not use activated charcoal at home. Activated charcoal can be administered to asymptomatic patients who have ingested overdoses of dextromethorphan within the preceding hour. Its administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grade D). 9) For patients who have ingested dextromethorphan and are sedated or comatose, naloxone, in the usual doses for treatment of opioid overdose, can be considered for prehospital administration, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression (Grade C). 10) Use intravenous benzodiazepines for seizures and benzodiazepines and external cooling measures for hyperthermia (>104 degrees F, >40 degrees C) for serotonin syndrome. This should be done in consultation with and authorized by EMS medical direction, by a written treatment protocol or policy, or with direct medical oversight (Grade C). 11) Carefully ascertain by history whether other drugs, such as acetaminophen, were involved in the incident and assess the risk for toxicity or for a drug interaction.',\n",
              "  'Increased lysosomal biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage after traumatic brain injury in progranulin-deficient mice. Progranulin (PGRN) is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients with the homozygous mutation in the GRN gene present with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and there is growing evidence that PGRN is related to lysosomal function. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of PGRN in the lysosomes of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalized with Lamp1, a lysosomal marker, and Lamp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient (KO) mice were significantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI. Expression of all the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice. The number of activated microglia with TFEB localized to the nucleus was also significantly increased in KO as compared with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in the lysosome, we compared ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects mTORC1 activity. S6K1 phosphorylation in KO mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive and fluoro-jade B-positive cells around the injury was significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in KO as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN localized in the lysosome is involved in the activation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to increased TFEB nuclear translocation with a resultant increase in lysosomal biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex after TBI.',\n",
              "  'Dermatitis herpetiformis: close to unravelling a disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterised by granular IgA precipitates in the papillary dermis. In contrast to other autoimmune blistering diseases, where tissue-deposited and circulating autoantibodies recognise the same target within the skin, in dermatitis herpetiformis a serum IgA reacting with a component of the healthy papillary dermis has not been detected. Recently, the antigenic specificity of pathognomic skin-bound IgA has been clarified: the immune precipitates contain epidermal transglutaminase, an enzyme not previously detected in the papillary region of normal skin. Furthermore, serum IgA in dermatitis herpetiformis has been found to bind epidermal transglutaminase. These findings may relate to the fact, that dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease, which is characterised by IgA type autoantibodies to a closely related enzyme, tissue transglutaminase. The two transglutaminases are highly homologous, and therefore, cross reactivity of the two antibodies might explain why patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy, with or without skin disease, generally have serum autoantibodies to both enzymes. There is growing evidence that dermatitis herpetiformis should be considered as the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity developing in those patients with mild coeliac disease, who produce epidermal transglutaminase autoantibodies of high avidity and affinity. Both the skin and the small bowel diseases are gluten dependent and are strongly associated with HLA DQ with no genetic differences to explain the two phenotypes. The question should be asked whether the rash in dermatitis herpetiformis is a classic autoimmune blistering disease or whether it has an immune complex basis, which is the most likely alternative.',\n",

The most common cause of sudden cardiac death in individuals aged less than 35 years, including competitive athletes, is the inherited disorder hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Until recently, no therapeutic intervention had been identified to prevent sudden death in HCM. This case report highlights the role of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in preventing sudden death in patients with HCM. The report highlights the importance of risk stratification in patients with HCM in order to identify those individuals who would most likely benefit from ICD therapy. The ICD implantation is now the treatment of choice in preventing sudden death in selected (highest risk) populations with HCM. In the future, understanding the molecular basis of sudden death in HCM may identify potential new gene-based therapeutic strategies.',\n",

We report a young woman with genetically confirmed Pendred syndrome and discuss the current therapeutic strategies of dyshormonogenetic goitre. A small diffuse thyroid enlargement developed during infancy and although substitution therapy with L-thyroxine was adequate, it progressed and underwent multinodular transformation. Cervical ultrasound at the age of 22 years demonstrated three solid nodules and fine-needle aspiration biopsy showed a finding typical of follicular adenoma. It is known that dyshormonogenetic goitres have a tendency to grow despite appropriate treatment with L-thyroxine. Management of a patient with Pendred syndrome requires careful follow-up and regular imaging of the thyroid. Although the therapeutic approach to dyshormonogenetic goitres is still controversial, in our patient we chose total thyroidectomy as the most advantageous method to prevent the development of malignancies that may arise more frequently from dyshormonogenetic goitres than from goitres of other aetiologies.',\n",
              "  'PPADS, a P2X receptor antagonist, as a novel inhibitor of the reverse mode of the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger in guinea pig airway smooth muscle. The Na(+)/Ca(2+)exchanger (NCX) principal function is taking 1 Ca(2+) out of the cytoplasm and introducing 3 Na(+). The increase of cytoplasmic Na(+) concentration induces the NCX reverse mode (NCX(REV)), favoring Ca(2+) influx. NCX(REV) can be inhibited by: KB-R7943 a non-specific compound that blocks voltage-dependent and store-operated Ca(2+) channels; SEA0400 that appears to be selective for NCX(REV), but difficult to obtain and SN-6, which efficacy has been shown only in cardiomyocytes. We found that PPADS, a P2X receptor antagonist, acts as a NCX(REV) inhibitor in guinea pig tracheal myocytes. In these cells, we characterized the NCX(REV) by substituting NaCl and NaHCO(3) with LiCl, resulting in the increase of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) using fura 2-AM. We analyzed 5 consecutive responses of the NCX(REV) every 10 min, finding no differences among them. To evaluate the effect of different NCX(REV) blockers, concentration response curves to KB-R7943 (1, 3.2 and 10 μM), and SN-6 (3.2, 10 and 30 μM) were constructed, whereas PPADS effect was characterized as time- and concentration-dependent (1, 3.2, 10 and 30 μM). PPADS had similar potency and efficacy as KB-R7943, whereas SN-6 was the least effective. Furthermore, KCl-induced contraction, sensitive to D600 and nifedipine, was blocked by KB-R7943, but not by PPADS. KCl-induced [Ca(2+)]i increment in myocytes was also significantly decreased by KBR-7943 (10 μM). Our results demonstrate that PPADS can be used as a reliable pharmacological tool to inhibit NCX(REV), with the advantage that it is more specific than KB-R7943 because it does not affect L-type Ca(2+) channels.',\n",
              "  'Regulation of anthrax toxin activator gene (atxA) expression in Bacillus anthracis: temperature, not CO2/bicarbonate, affects AtxA synthesis. Anthrax toxin gene expression in Bacillus anthracis is dependent on the presence of atxA, a trans-acting regulatory gene located on the resident 185-kb plasmid pXO1. In atxA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is enhanced by two physiologically significant signals: elevated CO2/bicarbonate and temperature. To determine whether increased toxin gene expression in response to these signals is associated with increased atxA expression, we monitored steady-state levels of atxA mRNA and AtxA protein in cells cultured in different conditions. We purified histidine-tagged AtxA [AtxA(His)] from Escherichia coli and used anti-AtxA(His) serum to detect AtxA in protein preparations from B. anthracis cells. AtxA was identified as a protein with an apparent size of 56 kDa in cytoplasmic fractions of B. anthracis cells. Our data indicate that atxA expression is not influenced by CO2/bicarbonate levels. However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cells grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate at 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higher than that observed in cells grown in the same conditions at 28 degrees C. A corresponding difference in AtxA protein was also seen at the different growth temperatures. When atxA was cloned on a multicopy plasmid in B. anthracis, AtxA levels corresponding to the atxA gene copy number were observed. However, this strain produced significantly less pag mRNA and protective antigen protein than the parental strain harboring atxA in single copy on pXO1. These results indicate that increased AtxA expression does not lead to a corresponding increase in pag expression. Our data strongly suggest that an additional factor(s) is involved in regulation of pag and that the relative amounts of such a factor(s) and AtxA are important for optimal toxin gene expression.',\n",
              "  'Positive and negative selection in murine ultraconserved noncoding elements. There are many more selectively constrained noncoding than coding nucleotides in the mammalian genome, but most mammalian noncoding DNA is subject to weak selection, on average. One of the most striking discoveries to have emerged from comparisons among mammalian genomes is the hundreds of noncoding elements of more than 200 bp in length that show absolute conservation among mammalian orders. These elements represent the tip of the iceberg of a much larger class of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). Much evidence suggests that CNEs are selectively constrained and not mutational cold-spots, and there is evidence that some CNEs play a role in the regulation of development. Here, we quantify negative and positive selection acting in murine CNEs by analyzing within-species nucleotide variation and between-species divergence of CNEs that we identified using a phylogenetically independent comparison. The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in CNEs, inferred from within-species polymorphism, suggests that CNEs receive a higher number of strongly selected deleterious mutations and many fewer nearly neutral mutations than amino acid sites of protein-coding genes or regulatory elements close to genes. However, we also show that CNEs experience a far higher proportion of adaptive substitutions than any known category of genomic sites in murids. The absolute rate of adaptation of CNEs is similar to that of amino acid sites of proteins. This result suggests that there is widespread adaptation in mammalian conserved noncoding DNA elements, some of which have been implicated in the regulation of crucially important processes, including development.',\n",
              "  'Small heat shock protein 20 interacts with protein phosphatase-1 and enhances sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling. BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are known to enhance cell survival under various stress conditions. In the heart, the small Hsp20 has emerged as a key mediator of protection against apoptosis, remodeling, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover, Hsp20 has been implicated in modulation of cardiac contractility ex vivo. The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo role of Hsp20 in the heart and the mechanisms underlying its regulatory effects in calcium (Ca) cycling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hsp20 overexpression in intact animals resulted in significant enhancement of cardiac function, coupled with augmented Ca cycling and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load in isolated cardiomyocytes. This was associated with specific increases in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at both Ser16 and Thr17, relieving its inhibition of the apparent Ca affinity of SERCA2a. Accordingly, the inotropic effects of Hsp20 were abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing nonphosphorylatable PLN (S16A/T17A). Interestingly, the activity of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1), a known regulator of PLN signaling, was significantly reduced by Hsp20 overexpression, suggesting that the Hsp20 stimulatory effects are partially mediated through the PP1-PLN axis. This hypothesis was supported by cell fractionation, coimmunoprecipitation, and coimmunolocalization studies, which revealed an association between Hsp20, PP1, and PLN. Furthermore, recombinant protein studies confirmed a physical interaction between AA 73 to 160 in Hsp20 and AA 163 to 330 in PP1. CONCLUSIONS: Hsp20 is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca cycling by targeting the PP1-PLN axis. These findings, coupled with the well-recognized cardioprotective role of Hsp20, suggest a dual benefit of targeting Hsp20 in heart disease.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Kx is lacking in the RBCs of patients with the McLeod syndrome. This condition is sometimes associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). If given allogeneic RBCs, CGD patients with the McLeod phenotype may produce anti-Kx and anti-Km, and only phenotypically matched McLeod blood would be compatible. McLeod phenotype persons without CGD have made anti-Km but not anti-Kx (2 examples), and thus both McLeod and K(O) blood would be compatible. CASE REPORT: RBCs from a transfused patient with the McLeod phenotype but not with CGD (non-CGD McLeod) were typed for the Kell blood group antigens, and the plasma was analyzed for the presence of antibody by agglutination. The molecular basis was determined by analyzing for XK protein on RBC membranes by Western immunoblotting, by sequencing the XK gene, and by RFLP. RESULTS: The RBCs did not react with anti-Kx + anti-Km and showed weakening of Kell system antigens. The patient's plasma reacted moderately (2+) with RBCs of common Kell type and strongly (4+) with K(O) RBCs and RBCs of common Kell type treated with dithiothreitol, and did not react with McLeod RBCs. XK protein was absent from the RBC membranes. The XK gene had a point mutation in the donor splice site of intron 1 (G>C). CONCLUSION: This is the first report describing the molecular alteration in a non-CGD McLeod patient who has made anti-Kx. The immune response of people with the McLeod phenotype can vary, and K(O) blood may not always be compatible.\",\n",

In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended. However, the frequency of biochemical thyroid assessment, particularly in the first year of life, is being debated. In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation. Therefore, treatment with L-thyroxinewas started. Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life.',\n",
              "  \"Brain and peripheral pharmacokinetics of levodopa in the cynomolgus monkey following administration of opicapone, a third generation nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of opicapone, a third generation nitrocatechol catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor, on the systemic and central bioavailability of 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (levodopa) and related metabolites in the cynomolgus monkey. METHODS: Four monkeys, implanted with guiding cannulas for microdialysis probes, in the substantia nigra, dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex, were randomized in two groups that received, in a crossover design, vehicle or 100 mg/kg opicapone for 14 days. Twenty-three hours after last administration of vehicle or opicapone, animals were challenged with levodopa/benserazide (12/3 mg/kg). Extracellular dialysate and blood samples were collected over 360 min (at 30 min intervals) for the assays of catecholamine and COMT activity. RESULTS: Opicapone increased levodopa systemic exposure by 2-fold not changing Cmax values and reduced both 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) exposure and Cmax values by 5-fold. These changes were accompanied by ∼76-84% reduction in erythrocyte COMT activity. In dorsal striatum and substantia nigra, opicapone increased levodopa exposure by 1.7- and 1.4-fold, respectively, reducing 3-OMD exposure by 5- and 7-fold respectively. DOPAC exposure was increased by 4-fold in the substantia nigra. In the prefrontal cortex, opicapone increased levodopa exposure and reduced 3-OMD levels by 2.3- and 2.4-fold, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone behaved as long-acting COMT inhibitor that markedly increased systemic and central levodopa bioavailability. Opicapone is a strong candidate to fill the unmet need for COMT inhibitors that lead to more sustained levodopa levels in Parkinson's disease patients.\",\n",
              "  'Hemoprotein Bach1 regulates enhancer availability of heme oxygenase-1 gene. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects cells from various insults including oxidative stress. Transcriptional activators, including the Nrf2/Maf heterodimer, have been the focus of studies on the inducible expression of ho-1. Here we show that a heme-binding factor, Bach1, is a critical physiological repressor of ho-1. Bach1 bound to the multiple Maf recognition elements (MAREs) of ho-1 enhancers with MafK in vitro and repressed their activity in vivo, while heme abrogated this repressor function of Bach1 by inhibiting its binding to the ho-1 enhancers. Gene targeting experiments in mice revealed that, in the absence of Bach1, ho-1 became expressed constitutively at high levels in various tissues under normal physiological conditions. By analyzing bach1/nrf2 compound-deficient mice, we documented antagonistic activities of Bach1 and Nrf2 in several tissues. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that small Maf proteins participate in both repression and activation of ho-1. Thus, regulation of ho-1 involves a direct sensing of heme levels by Bach1 (by analogy to lac repressor sensitivity to lactose), generating a simple feedback loop whereby the substrate effects repressor-activator antagonism.',\n",

              "  'mDia1-3 in mammalian filopodia. mDia proteins are members of the formin family of actin nucleating proteins that polymerize linear actin filaments. Such filaments form the core of thin, tubular, membrane-bound cell surface protrusions known as filopodia, which are a major feature of mammalian cell morphology. Filopodia are dynamic structures that help cells sense environmental cues, and play a role in cell migration, axon guidance, angiogenesis and other processes. RhoGTPases bind to and control the activity of mDia proteins, and several other binding partners of the three mDia1 isoforms-mDia1, mDia2 and mDia3-have been documented. Two independent pathways controlling mammalian filopodium formation have emerged, with one driven by the RhoGTPase Cdc42, and the other by Rif. While mDia2 has been the main formin implicated in forming filopodia, mDia1 has recently surfaced as the key formin utilized by both the Cdc42 and Rif pathways to drive filopodial protrusion.',\n",
              "  'One-year safety and tolerability profile of pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the 1-year safety profile of the dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease. METHODS: Patients received pridopidine 45 mg/day for 4 weeks then pridopidine 90 mg/day for 22 weeks in this 6-month open-label extension (OLE) of the 6-month MermaiHD randomized controlled trial (RCT). Any adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Patients were categorized by their RCT treatment group (placebo, pridopidine 45 mg/day, pridopidine 90 mg/day). RESULTS: Of the 386 patients who completed the RCT, 353 entered the OLE and 305 (86.4%) completed. In 1 year, similar percentages of patients from each group reported > 1 AE (placebo, 79.6% [n = 90/113]; 45 mg/day, 80.8% [n = 101/125]; 90 mg/day, 82.6% [n = 95/115]) and > 1 serious AE (8.0% [n = 9/113], 12.8% [n = 16/125], and 8.7% [n = 10/115], respectively). The AE profile across both studies was similar; falls and worsening of chorea were most commonly reported. During the OLE, more patients previously receiving pridopidine reported > 1 AE (67.9% [n = 163/240]) than those who had received placebo (56.6% [n = 64/113]). Early in the RCT, small increases in heart rate were reported in patients receiving pridopidine. During 1 year, no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters or EKG-related safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSION: Pridopidine ( < 90 mg/day) has an acceptable safety profile and is well-tolerated for 1 year. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that pridopidine ( < 90 mg/day) is generally safe and well-tolerated in patients with Huntington disease for up to 1 year.',\n",
              "  \"Synphilin isoforms and the search for a cellular model of lewy body formation in Parkinson's disease. A common finding in many neurodegenerative diseases is the presence of inclusion bodies made of aggregated proteins in neurons of affected brain regions. In Parkinson's disease, the inclusion bodies are referred to as Lewy bodies and their main component is alpha-synuclein. Although many studies have suggested that inclusion bodies may be cell protective, it is still not clear whether Lewy bodies promote or inhibit dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson's disease. Synphilin-1 interacts with alpha-synuclein and is present in Lewy bodies. Accumulation of ubiquitylated synphilin-1 leads to massive formation of inclusion bodies, which resemble Lewy bodies by their ability to recruit alpha-synuclein. We have recently isolated an isoform of synphilin-1, synphilin-1A, that spontaneously aggregates in cells, and is present in detergent-insoluble fractions of brain protein samples from alpha-synucleinopathy patients. Synphilin-1A displays marked neuronal toxicity and, upon proteasome inhibition, accumulates into ubiquitylated inclusions with concomitant reduction of its intrinsic toxicity. The fact that alpha-synuclein interacts with synphilin-1A, and is recruited to synphilin-1A inclusion bodies in neurons together with synphilin-1, further indicates that synphilin-1A cell model is relevant for research on Parkinson's disease. Synphilin-1A cell model may help provide important insights regarding the role of inclusion bodies in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\",\n",
              "  'Flumazenil use in benzodiazepine overdose in the UK: a retrospective survey of NPIS data. OBJECTIVE: Benzodiazepine (BZD) overdose (OD) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality in the UK. Flumazenil is an effective antidote but there is a risk of seizures, particularly in those who have co-ingested tricyclic antidepressants. A study was undertaken to examine the frequency of use, safety and efficacy of flumazenil in the management of BZD OD in the UK. METHODS: A 2-year retrospective cohort study was performed of all enquiries to the UK National Poisons Information Service involving BZD OD. RESULTS: Flumazenil was administered to 80 patients in 4504 BZD-related enquiries, 68 of whom did not have ventilatory failure or had recognised contraindications to flumazenil. Factors associated with flumazenil use were increased age, severe poisoning and ventilatory failure. Co-ingestion of tricyclic antidepressants and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease did not influence flumazenil administration. Seizure frequency in patients not treated with flumazenil was 0.3%. The frequency of prior seizure in flumazenil-treated patients was 30 times higher (8.8%). Seven patients who had seizures prior to flumazenil therapy had no recurrence of their seizures. Ventilation or consciousness improved in 70% of flumazenil-treated patients. Flumazenil administration was followed by one instance each of agitation and brief seizure. CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil is used infrequently in the management of BZD OD in the UK. It was effective and associated with a low incidence of seizure. These results compare favourably with the results of published randomised controlled trials and cohort studies, although previous studies have not reported the use of flumazenil in such a high-risk population. This study should inform the continuing review of national guidance on flumazenil therapy.',\n",

              "  \"Striatal glutamate release in L-DOPA-induced dyskinetic animals. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is a common side effect developed after chronic treatment with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA) in Parkinson's disease. The biological mechanisms behind this side effect are not fully comprehended although involvement of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems has been suggested. The present study utilizes in vivo amperometry to investigate the impact from unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions and l-DOPA (4 mg/kg, including benserazide 15 mg/kg) -induced dyskinetic behavior on striatal basal extracellular glutamate concentration and potassium-evoked glutamate release in urethane-anesthetized rats. Recordings were performed before and after local L-DOPA application in the striatum. In addition, effects from the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (2R)-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OHDPAT; 1 mg/kg) was assessed on glutamate release and on dyskinetic behavior. The results revealed a bilateral = 30% reduction of basal extracellular glutamate concentration and attenuated potassium-evoked glutamate release after a unilateral dopamine-depletion in L-DOPA naïve animals. In dyskinetic subjects, basal glutamate concentration was comparable to normal controls, although potassium-evoked glutamate release was reduced to similar levels as in drug naïve dopamine-lesioned animals. Furthermore, acute striatal L-DOPA administration attenuated glutamate release in all groups, except in the dopamine-lesioned striatum of dyskinetic animals. Co-administration of 8-OHDPAT and L-DOPA decreased dyskinesia in dopamine-lesioned animals, but did not affect potassium-evoked glutamate release, which was seen in normal animals. These findings indicate altered glutamate transmission upon dopamine-depletion and dyskinesia.\",\n",
              "  'The Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale: development and validation of a stroke recognition instrument. BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.',\n",
              "  'Investigational anticoagulants for hematological conditions: a new generation of therapies. INTRODUCTION: The introduction of novel anticoagulants has had contrasting effects on the agents in the pipeline, fueling the development of some and sinking the others. The complexity of the coagulation cascade offers interesting inhibition choices that might become valid treatment options. AREAS COVERED: This review will highlight some of the anticoagulants in the pipeline. Following the success of the direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors already in the market, new agents are being tested. These include AZD0837, betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, and LY517717. Targeting other components of the hemostatic pathway might lead to better safety profiles without influencing efficacy. Inhibitors to FVIIa-tissue factor (FVIIa/TF) complex, FIX, FXI, and FXII are being assessed. New inspiring inhibitors are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and aptamers. These are highly specific agents with readily reversible effect and might be engineered to inhibit any coagulation factor. Currently tested ASOs and aptamers are inhibitors of FXI, FXII, thrombin, FIXa, and platelet GPIV. EXPERT OPINION: Some of the agents in the pipeline offer valid treatment option for long-term therapy, overcoming some of the drawbacks of the novel anticoagulants. Research is being driven by an expanding market in the anticoagulation field that has been unexploited for a long time.',\n",
              "  'Defective intracellular transport of CLN3 is the molecular basis of Batten disease (JNCL) Batten disease [juvenile-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL)], the most common progressive encephalopathy of childhood, is caused by mutations in a novel lysosomal membrane protein (CLN3) with unknown function. In this study, we have confirmed the lysosomal localization of the CLN3 protein by immunoelectron microscopy by co-localizing it with soluble and membrane-associated lysosomal proteins. We have analysed the intracellular processing and localization of two mutants, 461-677del, which is present in 85% of CLN3 alleles and causes the classical JNCL, and E295K [corrected], which is a rare missense mutation associated with an atypical form of JNCL. Pulse-chase labelling and immunoprecipitation of the two mutant proteins in COS-1-cells indicated that 461-677del is synthesized as an approximately 24 kDa truncated polypeptide, whereas the maturation of E295K [corrected] resembles that of the wild-type CLN3 polypeptide. Transient expression of the two mutants in BHK cells showed that 461-677del is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas E295K [corrected] was capable of reaching the lysosomal compartment. The CLN3 polypeptides were expressed further in mouse primary neurons where the wild-type CLN3 protein was localized both in the cell soma and in neuronal extensions, whereas the 461-677del mutant was arrested in the cell soma. Interestingly, co-localization of the wild-type CLN3 and E295K [corrected] proteins with a synaptic vesicle marker indicates that the CLN3 protein might participate in synaptic vesicle transport/transmission. The data presented here provide clear evidence for a cellular distinction between classical and atypical forms of Batten disease both in neural and non-neural cells.',\n",
              "  'Antioxidative and cardioprotective effects of Phyllanthus urinaria L. on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiac toxicity is a major adverse effect caused by doxorubicin (DOX) therapy. Many recent studies have shown that DOX toxicity involves generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although protection or alleviation of DOX toxicity can be achieved by administration of antioxidant vitamins such as ascorbic acid and vitamin E, their cardioprotective effect remains controversial. Thus alternative naturally occurring antioxidants may potentially be candidates for antioxidant therapy. In this study, we investigated the antioxidative and cytoprotective effects of Phyllanthus urinaria (PU) against DOX toxicity using H9c2 cardiac myoblasts. The total antioxidant capacity of PU (1 mg/ml) was 5306.75+/-461.62 FRAP value (microM). DOX IC50 values were used to evaluate the cytoprotective effects of PU ethanolic extract (1 or 10 microg/ml) in comparison with those of ascorbic acid (VIT C, 100 microM) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 100 microM). PU treatments (1 or 10 microg/ml) dose dependently caused rightward DOX IC50 shifts of 2.8- and 8.5-fold, respectively while treatments with VIT C and NAC increased DOX IC50 by 3.3- and 4.2-fold, respectively. Additionally, lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activity were parameters used to evaluate cytoprotective effect. All antioxidants completely inhibited cellular lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activation induced by DOX (1 microM). Endogenous antioxidant defense such as total glutathione (tGSH), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was also modulated by the antioxidants. PU treatment alone dose dependently increased tGSH, and this effect was retained in the presence of DOX. Similar effect was observed in the assessment of catalase and SOD enzyme activity. The nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) transcription factor assay demonstrated that all antioxidants significantly inhibited DOX-induced NFkappaB activation. Our results suggest that PU protection against DOX cardiotoxicity was mediated through multiple pathways and this plant may serve as an alternative source of antioxidants for prevention of DOX cardiotoxicity.',\n",
              "  'Involvement of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in myocardial injury of hereditary epileptic rats. Many clinical cases have been reported where epilepsy profoundly influenced the pathophysiological function of the heart; however, the underlying mechanisms were not elucidated. We use the tremor (TRM) rat as an animal model of epilepsy to investigate the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury. Cardiac functions were assessed by arrhythmia score, heart rate, heart:body mass ratio, and hemodynamic parameters including left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise and fall (+dp/dtmax and -dp/dtmax). Catecholamine level was detected by HPLC. Apoptotic index was estimated by TUNEL assay. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNK), and p38 were evaluated by Western blot. The results indicated that there existed cardiac dysfunction and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, accompanied by increasing catecholamine levels in TRM rats. Further investigation revealed that apoptosis was mediated by reducing Bcl-2, upregulating Bax, and activating caspase-3. Additional experiments demonstrated that P-ERK1/2 was decreased, whereas P-JNK and P-p38 were up-regulated. Our results suggest that the sympathetic nervous system activation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis are involved in the myocardial injury of TRM rats. The mechanisms of apoptosis might be associated with the activation of the mitochondria-initiated and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.',\n",

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a slowly progressive myopathy with autosomal dominant inheritance remarkable for its early involvement of facial musculature. The purpose of our study was to assess the rate of strength deterioration, functional condition and performance of activity of daily living of patients with FSHD in Taiwan. Twenty patients diagnosed with FSHD were included in this study. Manual muscle testing (MMT) was used to evaluate muscle strength. The Brooke and Vignos scales were used to assess upper and lower extremity function respectively, and the capability of the activity of daily living was measured by Barthel index. The result of the strength testing was characterized by the presence of a progressive asymmetrical muscular weakness in patients with FSHD. The mean muscular strength of the right extremity was weaker than its left counterparts (p < 0.05) and the shoulder muscle group was the weakest. According to the Brooke functional scale, 20% of our patients were graded as 1, 30% as grade 2, and 50% as grade 3. On the Vignos functional scale, 50% of patients fell into grade 1, 10% in grade 2, and 40% in grades 3-5. Vignos scale was significantly correlated with mean muscle strength (p < 0.05). The average value of Barthel index was 97.8 +/- 4.7. The muscle strength decline in this Taiwanese of FSHD population was more severe in shoulder girdle area. The mean muscle strength of the right extremity was weaker than the left. Most of our patients suffered from mild or moderate physical disability. Finding of these Taiwanese FSHD population is similar to those reported elsewhere in the world.',\n",

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by defective neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals. It is caused by an IgG autoantibody reacting against voltage-gated calcium channels. Severe LEMS complicated by ventilatory failure is rare. We report a case of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) presenting with LEMS and ventilatory failure in a 67-year-old man who initially presented with progressive limb weakness for 6 months and tachypnea with shallow breathing for 1 week. LEMS was diagnosed through electrophysiologic studies. Chest radiography and computerized tomography showed a huge mass lesion over the left anterior and middle mediastinum with an encasement of the left pulmonary artery. Cytologic examination of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration disclosed SCLC. Successful treatment in combination with plasma exchange and chemotherapy resulted in dramatic tumor regression and LEMS remission, which were confirmed by chest radiography and electrophysiologic studies. This case suggests that plasma exchange and chemotherapy can be effective in treating SCLC with severe LEMS that produces ventilatory failure.',\n",

FSHD is caused by deletion of a subset of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat units in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. In FSHD, the combination of inefficient chromatin silencing of the D4Z4 repeat and polymorphisms on the FSHD-permissive alleles that stabilize the DUX4 mRNAs emanating from the repeat result in inappropriate DUX4 protein expression in muscle cells. FSHD is thereby the first example of a human disease caused by the inefficient repression of a retrogene in a macrosatellite repeat array.',\n",

In the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), disorders of the thyroid function and morphology have been reported and programs of thyroid screening and surveillance are recommended. However, the frequency of biochemical thyroid assessment, particularly in the first year of life, is being debated. In this report we describe an infant with WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due to an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old female, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of the neck showed a significant thyroid hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixation. Therefore, treatment with L-thyroxinewas started. Thyroid hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalities of thyroid function are common in patients with this feature. Therefore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even if congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyroid (morphology and function) evaluation should be regularly assessed when the diagnosis is made and, thereafter, every year in the first years of life.',\n",
              "  'Heme positively regulates the expression of beta-globin at the locus control region via the transcriptional factor Bach1 in erythroid cells. The transcription factor Bach1 heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins to repress Maf recognition element (MARE)-dependent gene expression. The repressor activity of Bach1 is inhibited by the direct binding of heme. To investigate the involvement of Bach1 in the heme-dependent regulation of the expression of the beta-globin gene, mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were cultured with succinylacetone (SA), a specific inhibitor of heme biosynthesis, and the level of beta-globin mRNA was examined. A marked decrease of beta-globin mRNA in SA-treated cells was observed, and this decrease was reversed by the addition of hemin. An iron chelator, desferrioxamine, also lowered the level of beta-globin mRNA. The heme-dependent expression of beta-globin is a transcriptional event since the expression of the human beta-globin gene promoter-reporter gene containing the microlocus control region (microLCR) was inhibited when human erythroleukemia K562 cells and MEL cells were cultured with SA. Hemin treatment restored the decrease in promoter activity caused by SA. The control of the microLCR-beta-globin promoter reporter gene by heme was dependent on DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 (HS2), which contains MARE. The MARE binding activity of Bach1 in K562 and MEL cells increased upon SA treatment, and the increase was diminished by the treatment with hemin. Transient expression of Bach1 suppressed the microLCR activity, and this repressor activity was cancelled by treatment with hemin. The expression of a mutated Bach1 lacking heme-binding sites led to a loss in the heme responsiveness of the microLCR. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Bach1 bound to the MARE of HS2 increased by the treatment of MEL cells with SA, and this was cancelled by hemin. We propose that heme positively regulates the beta-globin gene expression by blocking the interaction of Bach1 with the MARE in the LCR.',\n",
              "  'Update on denosumab in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: patient preference and adherence. Patient adherence to many osteoporosis treatments, primarily bisphosphonates, is generally poor, thus leading to a significant reduction in antifracture efficacy. Patient perceptions about the necessity of the prescribed medication to treat osteoporosis and the concerns about the potential adverse effects are important and potentially modifiable determinants of adherence, in addition to other factors, such as difficult dosing regimens and high dosing frequency. Denosumab (Dmab) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), which, through the prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction, inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and significantly reduces the risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures. It is administered subcutaneously every 6 months for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Preference and adherence to Dmab treatment were assessed in various clinical trials. Although with some limitations, available data suggest that Dmab is preferred to bisphosphonates, produces greater satisfaction than bisphosphonates, and would be preferentially chosen for long-term treatment. Moreover, patient perceptions about the necessity of Dmab treatment clearly outweigh the concerns about the injections, and positive beliefs about treatment positively influence medication-taking behavior. According to these data, Dmab may represent a reasonable alternative to bisphosphonates, particularly for osteoporotic women in whom a suboptimal or even poor adherence to oral treatments is expected.',\n",

              "  'Familial pediatric rapidly progressive extrapyramidal syndrome: is it Hallervorden-Spatz disease? The clinical features of two children of a family with rapidly progressive extrapyramidal-pyramidal-dementia complex have been described. Inheritance seems most likely to be autosomal recessive. Magnetic resonance imaging results of brain were negative. Even so, the authors argued in favor of a diagnosis of Hallervorden-Spatz disease because the cases fulfilled the clinical criteria for diagnosis of this disease. Apart from the negative magnetic resonance findings, the other unusual feature was the early development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Few conditions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a childhood-onset rapidly progressive extrapyramidal syndrome. Such conditions include Wilson\\'s disease, Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD), juvenile form of Huntington\\'s disease, juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, early-onset Machado-Joseph disease neuroacanthocytosis, storage disorders, and variant form of dopa-response dystonias (DRD). Rarer conditions are Leigh\\'s disease, Lafora body disease, and dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy. HSD is a rare disorder characterized by progressive extrapyramidal dysfunction and dementia. Onset is most commonly in late childhood or early adolescence. The disease can be familial or sporadic. When familial, it is inherited recessively and has been linked to chromosome 20. Recently, a mutation in the pantothenate kinase (PANK2) gene on band 20pl3 has been described in patients with typical HSD. HSD produces typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in brain, aiding in antemortem diagnosis. The typical finding is of bilaterally symmetrical hyperintense signal changes in the external segment of globus pallidus, with surrounding hypointensity on T(2)-weighted image. These imaging features are fairly diagnostic and have been termed the \"eye-of-the tiger sign\". The hyperintensity represents pathologic changes, including gliosis, demyelination, neuronal loss, and axonal swelling, and the surrounding hypointensity is caused by loss of signal secondary to iron deposition. Described herein are the clinical aspects of a family with autosomal recessive inheritance with rapidly progressive extrapyramidal-pyramidal-dementia complex but with negative brain MRI results. The diagnosis should be considered a variant form of HSD.',\n",
              "  'Battle of the eternal rivals: restoring functional p53 and inhibiting Polo-like kinase 1 as cancer therapy. Polo-like kinase 1, a pivotal regulator of mitosis and cytokinesis, is highly expressed in a broad spectrum of tumors and its expression correlates often with poor prognosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. p53, the guardian of the genome, is the most important tumor suppressor. In this review, we address the intertwined relationship of these two key molecules by fighting each other as eternal rivals in many signaling pathways. p53 represses the promoter of Polo-like kinase 1, whereas Polo-like kinase 1 inhibits p53 and its family members p63 and p73 in cancer cells lacking functional p53. Plk1 inhibitors target all rapidly dividing cells irrespective of tumor cells or non-transformed normal but proliferating cells. Upon treatment with Plk1 inhibitors, p53 in tumor cells is activated and induces strong apoptosis, whereas tumor cells with inactive p53 arrest in mitosis with DNA damage. Thus, inactive p53 is not associated with a susceptible cytotoxicity of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition and could rather foster the induction of polyploidy/aneuploidy in surviving cells. In addition, compared to the mono-treatment, combination of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibition with anti-mitotic or DNA damaging agents boosts more severe mitotic defects, effectually triggers apoptosis and strongly inhibits proliferation of cancer cells with functional p53. In this regard, restoration of p53 in tumor cells with loss or mutation of p53 will reinforce the cytotoxicity of combined Polo-like kinase 1 therapy and provide a proficient strategy for combating relapse and metastasis of cancer.',\n",

Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene due to 5q35 microdeletions or intragenic mutations is the major cause of Sotos syndrome characterized by generalized overgrowth, large hands and feet with advanced bone age, craniofacial dysmorphic features, learning disability, and possible susceptibility to tumors. Here, we report on a 14-month-old boy with a reverse phenotype of Sotos syndrome due to the reciprocal duplication of the 5q35.3 region, including the NSD1 gene, detected by array CGH. The phenotype includes delayed bone age, microcephaly, seizures, and failure to thrive. Our case suggests that the gene dosage effect of the NSD1 gene is the likely cause for the reversed phenotype of Sotos syndrome in this patient.',\n",

Investigation of the patient's XK gene revealed a novel TGG- to-TAG transition at position 1023 in exon 3. This point mutation creates an in-frame stop codon (W314X), and predicts a truncated XK protein of 313 amino acids, compared with 444 amino acids in the normal XK protein.

Embryonic neuroepithelia and adult subventricular zone (SVZ) stem and progenitor cells express nestin. We characterized a transgenic line that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) specified to neural tissue by the second intronic enhancer of the nestin promoter that had several novel features. During embryogenesis, the dorsal telencephalon contained many and the ventral telencephalon few eGFP+ cells. eGFP+ cells were found in postnatal and adult neurogenic regions. eGFP+ cells in the SVZ expressed multiple phenotype markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein, Dlx, and neuroblast-specific molecules suggesting the transgene is expressed through the lineage. eGFP+ cell numbers increased in the SVZ after cortical injury, suggesting this line will be useful in probing postinjury neurogenesis. In non-neurogenic regions, eGFP was strongly expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors, but not in astrocytes, even when they were reactive. This eGFP+ mouse will facilitate studies of proliferative neuroepithelia and adult neurogenesis, as well as of parenchymal oligodendrocytes.',\n",
              "  'Altered dopaminergic profile in the putamen and substantia nigra in restless leg syndrome. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder. Clinical studies have implicated the dopaminergic system in RLS, while others have suggested that it is associated with insufficient levels of brain iron. To date, alterations in brain iron status have been demonstrated but, despite suggestions from the clinical literature, there have been no consistent findings documenting a dopaminergic abnormality in RLS brain tissue. In this study, the substantia nigra and putamen were obtained at autopsy from individuals with primary RLS and a neurologically normal control group. A quantitative profile of the dopaminergic system was obtained. Additional assays were performed on a catecholaminergic cell line and animal models of iron deficiency. RLS tissue, compared with controls, showed a significant decrease in D2R in the putamen that correlated with severity of the RLS. RLS also showed significant increases in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra, compared with the controls, but not in the putamen. Both TH and phosphorylated (active) TH were significantly increased in both the substantia nigra and putamen. There were no significant differences in either the putamen or nigra for dopamine receptor 1, dopamine transporters or for VMAT. Significant increases in TH and phosphorylated TH were also seen in both the animal and cell models of iron insufficiency similar to that from the RLS autopsy data. For the first time, a clear indication of dopamine pathology in RLS is revealed in this autopsy study. The results suggest cellular regulation of dopamine production that closely matches the data from cellular and animal iron insufficiency models. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a primary iron insufficiency produces a dopaminergic abnormality characterized as an overly activated dopaminergic system as part of the RLS pathology.',\n",
              "  'The anthrax toxin activator gene atxA is associated with CO2-enhanced non-toxin gene expression in Bacillus anthracis. The Bacillus anthracis toxin genes, cya, lef, and pag, can be viewed as a regulon, in which transcription of all three genes is activated in trans by the same regulatory gene, atxA, in response to the same signal, CO2. In atxA+ strains, toxin gene expression is increased 5- to 20-fold in cells grown in 5% CO2 relative to cells grown in air. CO2-enhanced toxin gene transcription is not observed in atx4-null mutants. Here, we used two independent techniques to obtain evidence for additional CO2-induced atxA-regulated genes. First, total protein preparations from atxA4+ and atxA isolates grown in 5% CO2 and in air were examined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Comparison of the resulting protein patterns indicated that synthesis of non-toxin proteins is influenced by growth in elevated CO2 and the toxin gene regulator, atxA. Second, we generated random transcriptional lacZ fusions in B. anthracis with transposon Tn917-LTV3. Transposon-insertion libraries were screened for mutants expressing CO2-enhanced atxA-dependent beta-galactosidase activity. DNA sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites in 17 mutants carrying CO2- and atxA-regulated fusions revealed 10 mutants carrying independent insertions on the 185-kb toxin plasmid pXO1 which did not map to the toxin genes. The tcr-lacZ fusion mutants (tcr for toxin coregulated) were Tox+, indicating that these genes may not be involved in anthrax toxin gene activation. Our data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B. anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins.',\n",
              "  \"Dynamics, stability and iron-binding activity of frataxin clinical mutants. Friedreich's ataxia results from a deficiency in the mitochondrial protein frataxin, which carries single point mutations in some patients. In the present study, we analysed the consequences of different disease-related mutations in vitro on the stability and dynamics of human frataxin. Two of the mutations, G130V and D122Y, were investigated for the first time. Analysis by CD spectroscopy demonstrated a substantial decrease in the thermodynamic stability of the variants during chemical and thermal unfolding (wild-type > W155R > I154F > D122Y > G130V), which was reversible in all cases. Protein dynamics was studied in detail and revealed that the mutants have distinct propensities towards aggregation. It was observed that the mutants have increased correlation times and different relative ratios between soluble and insoluble/aggregated protein. NMR showed that the clinical mutants retained a compact and relatively rigid globular core despite their decreased stabilities. Limited proteolysis assays coupled with LC-MS allowed the identification of particularly flexible regions in the mutants; interestingly, these regions included those involved in iron-binding. In agreement, the iron metallochaperone activity of the Friedreich's ataxia mutants was affected: some mutants precipitate upon iron binding (I154F and W155R) and others have a lower binding stoichiometry (G130V and D122Y). Our results suggest that, in heterozygous patients, the development of Friedreich's ataxia may result from a combination of reduced efficiency of protein folding and accelerated degradation in vivo, leading to lower than normal concentrations of frataxin. This hypothesis also suggests that, although quite different from other neurodegenerative diseases involving toxic aggregation, Friedreich's ataxia could also be linked to a process of protein misfolding due to specific destabilization of frataxin.\",\n",
              "  'Pestivirus virion morphogenesis in the absence of uncleaved nonstructural protein 2-3. The family Flaviviridae contains three genera of positive-strand RNA viruses, namely, Flavivirus, Hepacivirus (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV]), and Pestivirus. Pestiviruses, like bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bear a striking degree of similarity to HCV concerning polyprotein organization, processing, and function. Along this line, in both systems, release of nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is essential for viral RNA replication. However, both viruses differ significantly with respect to processing efficiency at the NS2/3 cleavage site and abundance as well as functional relevance of uncleaved NS2-3. In BVDV-infected cells, significant amounts of NS2-3 accumulate at late time points postinfection and play an essential but ill-defined role in the production of infectious virions. In contrast, complete cleavage of the HCV NS2-3 counterpart has been reported, and unprocessed NS2-3 is not required throughout the life cycle of HCV, at least in cell culture. Here we describe the selection and characterization of the first pestiviral genome with the capability to complete productive infection in the absence of uncleaved NS2-3. Despite the insertion of a ubiquitin gene or an internal ribosomal entry site between the NS2 and NS3 coding sequences, the selected chimeric BVDV-1 genomes gave rise to infectious virus progeny. In this context, a mutation in the N-terminal third of NS2 was identified as a critical determinant for efficient production of infectious virions in the absence of uncleaved NS2-3. These findings challenge a previously accepted dogma for pestivirus replication and provide new implications for virion morphogenesis of pestiviruses and HCV.',\n",
              "  'In vivo Bacillus anthracis gene expression requires PagR as an intermediate effector of the AtxA signalling cascade. Transcription of the major Bacillus anthracis virulence genes is triggered by CO2, a signal mimicking the host environment. A 182-kb plasmid, pXO1, carries the anthrax toxin genes and the genes responsible for their regulation of transcription, namely atxA and, pagR, the second gene of the pag operon. AtxA has major effects on the physiology of B. anthracis. It coordinates the transcription activation of the toxin genes with that of the capsule biosynthetic enzyme operon, located on the second virulence plasmid, pXO2. In rich medium, B. anthracis synthesises alternatively two S-layer proteins (Sap and EA1). An exponential phase \"Sap-layer\" is subsequently replaced by a stationary phase \"EA1-layer\". S-layer gene transcription is controlled by alternative sigma factors and by Sap acting as a transcriptional repressor of eag. Furthermore, in vitro in presence of CO2 and in vivo, AtxA is part of the sap and eag regulatory network. Only eag is significantly expressed in these conditions and this is due to AtxA activating eag and repressing sap transcription. PagR, and not AtxA itself, is the direct effector of this regulation by binding to sap and eag promoter regions. Therefore, PagR mediates the effect of AtxA on eag and sap and is the most downstream element of a signalling cascade initiated by AtxA. Taken together, these results indicate that the B. anthracis transcriptional regulator AtxA is controlling the synthesis of the three toxin components and of the surface elements (capsule and S-layer). Thus, AtxA is a master regulator that coordinates the response to host signals by orchestrating positive and negative controls over genes located on all genetic elements.',\n",
              "  \"Different intracellular compartmentalization of TA and DeltaNp73 in non-small cell lung cancer. The p53 homologue p73 is overexpressed in many tumors, including lung cancer. We have evaluated the differential expression and subcellular localization of the functionally distinct apoptotic (TA) and anti-apoptotic (DeltaN) isoforms of p73 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their possible association with p53 expression and determined the methylation status of the two p73 gene promoters (P1 and P2) in this tumor type. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that both isoforms are expressed in the majority of cases. However, the oncogenic DeltaN variant, derived from the transcripts DeltaN'p73 (from P1) and/or DeltaNp73 (from P2), is localized mainly in the nucleus, while the anti-oncogenic TAp73 isoform (derived from a P1 transcript) is sequestered in the cytoplasm in almost all cases analyzed. Significant correlation was found between p53 and DeltaNp73 expression (p=0.041). Methylation analysis conducted on 41 tumor samples showed that the P1 promoter is almost invariably unmethylated (39/41 cases) whereas P2 was found completely methylated in 17 cases and partially or totally unmethylated in 24 samples. No correlation was found between the methylation status of P1 and P2 and p73 expression. Our results demonstrate that both isoforms contribute to p73 overexpression in NSCLC and suggest that their different intracellular localization may reflect an alteration of the functional p53-p73 network that might contribute to lung cancer development.\",\n",
              "  \"Delayed L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia. Previously we reported on L-DOPA's antinociceptive effect on substance P-induced nociceptive behaviors in mice [Shimizu T, Iwata S, Morioka H, Masuyama T, Fukuda T, Nomoto M. Antinociceptive mechanism of L-DOPA. Pain 2004;110;246-9.]. Since significant hyperalgesia was noted following antinociception, our study was designed to investigate the mechanism of this hyperalgesia. Nociceptive behaviors were enhanced 2 h after L-DOPA administration. L-DOPA induced hyperalgesia occurred after conversion to dopamine because co-administration of benserazide, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, completely abolished the L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia. The D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, depressed these behaviors entirely, while the D1 antagonist, SCH23390, inhibited the enhancement of these behaviors by L-DOPA. The D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride, which induced hyperalgesia of the substance P-induced behaviors in naive mice, did not have any effects on L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia. Spinal cord dopamine content increased rapidly after L-DOPA administration, exhibiting levels 100 times greater than baseline, and then returned to control after 1 h. These results suggested that the dopaminergic inhibitory system for pain sensation was temporarily impaired by excess amounts of exogenous dopamine that were derived from L-DOPA and both D1 and D2 receptors were involved in L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia.\",\n",
              "  'GBshape: a genome browser database for DNA shape annotations. Many regulatory mechanisms require a high degree of specificity in protein-DNA binding. Nucleotide sequence does not provide an answer to the question of why a protein binds only to a small subset of the many putative binding sites in the genome that share the same core motif. Whereas higher-order effects, such as chromatin accessibility, cooperativity and cofactors, have been described, DNA shape recently gained attention as another feature that fine-tunes the DNA binding specificities of some transcription factor families. Our Genome Browser for DNA shape annotations (GBshape; freely available at http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/) provides minor groove width, propeller twist, roll, helix twist and hydroxyl radical cleavage predictions for the entire genomes of 94 organisms. Additional genomes can easily be added using the GBshape framework. GBshape can be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative values of DNA shape features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide resolution. As biological applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNA shape features that are present in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fly and worm, and we demonstrate structural similarities between transcription start sites in the genomes of four Drosophila species.',\n",

AIM: To determine the utility of the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale as a stroke recognition tool among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compared with the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS), emergency physicians prospectively used the ROSIER as a stroke recognition tool on suspected patients in the prehospital setting. And, the final discharge diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack made by neurologists, after assessment and review of clinical symptomatology and brain imaging findings, was used as the reference standard for diagnosis in the study. Then, the ROSIER and the CPSS like sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), related coefficient (r) and Kappa value were calculated. RESULTS: In this study, 540 of 582 suspected stroke patients met the study criteria. The CPSS showed a diagnostic Se of 88.77% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 86.11-91.43%), Sp of 68.79% (95% CI 64.88-72.70%), PPV of 87.40% (95% CI 85.97-88.83%), NPV of 71.52% (95% CI 67.71-75.33%) and r of 0.503. Relatively, the ROSIER showed a diagnostic Se of 89.97% (95% CI 87.44-92.64%), Sp of 83.23% (95% CI 80.08-86.38%), PPV of 92.66% (95% CI 90.46-94.86%), NPV of 77.91% (95% CI 74.41-81.41%) and r of 0.584. According to the final discharge diagnosis, both the ROSIER and the CPSS were associated with the final discharge diagnosis (P < 0.05).The Kappa statistic value of the ROSIER and the CPSS were 0.718 and 0.582, respectively. However, there was no statistical significance of the positive rate between the ROSIER and the CPSS in this study (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The ROSIER is a sensitive and specific stroke recognition tool for health providers' use among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. However, it cannot be used to confidently rule out or identify stroke as a diagnosis. Comprehensive clinical assessment and further examination on potential stroke patients are still important and cannot be replaced. When it is difficult to objectively complete the ROSIER for patients, the CPSS could replace it in the prehospital setting.\",\n",

Compared with Sleeping Beauty, PiggyBac exhibits higher transposition efficiencies, no evidence for local hopping and a significant bias toward reintegration in intragenic regions, which demonstrate its utility for insertional mutagenesis.

              "  'Peroxiredoxin 2 and peroxide metabolism in the erythrocyte. Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is an antioxidant enzyme that uses cysteine residues to decompose peroxides. Prx2 is the third most abundant protein in erythrocytes, and competes effectively with catalase and glutathione peroxidase to scavenge low levels of hydrogen peroxide, including that derived from hemoglobin autoxidation. Low thioredoxin reductase activity in the erythrocyte is able to keep up with this basal oxidation and maintain the Prx2 in its reduced form, but exposure to exogenous hydrogen peroxide causes accumulation of the disulfide-linked dimer. The high cellular concentration means that although turnover is slow, erythrocyte Prx2 can act as a noncatalytic scavenger of hydrogen peroxide and a sink for hydrogen peroxide before turnover becomes limiting. The consequences of Prx2 oxidation for the erythrocyte are not well characterized, but mice deficient in this protein develop severe hemolytic anemia associated with Heinz body formation. Prx2, also known as calpromotin, regulates ion transport by associating with the membrane and activating the Gárdos channel. How Prx2 redox transformations are linked to membrane association and channel activation is yet to be established. In this review, we discuss the functional properties of Prx2 and its role as a major component of the erythrocyte antioxidant system.',\n",

They do not require routine coagulation monitoring. However, in special clinical settings (emergency surgery, bleeding, thrombosis, control of the patient's compliance, suspected overdose, potential drug interference, and so on), measurement of plasma levels is needed. Several available anti-FXa assays are used for monitoring anticoagulant activity of heparins and fondaparinux. They must be modified and standardized for the measurement of direct FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban and others). The use of calibrators (lyophilized plasma with a known concentration of drug) allows an expression of the results in ng per ml of plasma. Two categories of assays - endogenous and exogenous assays are available. Endogenous assays are useful in pharmaceutical research, while exogenous assays are used in clinical laboratories. The preferred anti-FXa assay is a specific method in contrast to prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, but it is not available everywhere at any time. A specific measurement of direct FXa inhibitors is feasible with the use of a new test developed by the authors' group. The physicians must be aware of the possibility to measure the plasma concentration of FXa inhibitors in patients at high risk of bleeding and in several other special clinical situations.\",\n",

INTRODUCTION: Since the initial approval of imatinib much has been learned about its resistance mechanisms, and efforts have continued to improve upon BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Targeted therapy with TKIs has continued to be an area of active research and development in the care of acute and chronic leukemia patients. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews current approved and investigational TKI treatments for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). EXPERT OPINION: There are now more potent BCR-ABL TKIs approved, which allow for additional options when determining front-line and second-line CML and Ph + ALL treatments. The T315I mutation is an ever-present challenge. Ponatinib, a pan BCR-ABL TKI, while still under investigation, is very hopeful with its ability to overcome T315I mutations in resistant CML and Ph + ALL patients. Because nilotinib and dasatinib have not been directly compared, at present we recommend selecting one or the other based on the side-effect profile, drug interactions, patient comorbidities, and mutational status. FLT-3 inhibition is of particular interest in AML patients with FLT-3 internal tandem duplication mutations; this type of targeted therapy continues to be studied.',\n",

When the levels of intracellular amino acids are high, RRAG GTPases recruit MTORC1 to lysosomes and promote its activation. We found that RRAGs also recruit specific MTORC1 substrates to the lysosomal surface, thus facilitating MTORC1-mediated phosphorylation and regulation. In particular, active RRAGs interact with the transcription factor EB (TFEB), the master regulator of a gene network that promotes lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Redistribution to lysosomes is critical for MTORC1-dependent inactivation of TFEB under nutrient-rich conditions. Therefore, RRAGs play a critical role coordinating nutrient availability and cellular clearance.',\n",
              "  'TAp73 regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint by modulating BubR1 activity. The role of various p73 isoforms in tumorigenesis has been controversial. However, as we have recently shown, the generation of TAp73-deficient (TAp73(-/-)) mice reveals that TAp73 isoforms exert tumor-suppressive functions, indicating an emerging role for Trp-73 in the maintenance of genomic stability. Unlike mice lacking all p73 isoforms, TAp73(-/-) mice show a high incidence of spontaneous tumors. Moreover, TAp73(-/-) mice are infertile and produce oocytes exhibiting spindle abnormalities. These data suggest a link between TAp73 activities and the common molecular machinery underlying meiosis and mitosis. Previous studies have indicated that the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) complex, whose activation leads to mitotic arrest, also regulates meiosis. In this study, we demonstrate in murine and human cells that TAp73 is able to interact directly with several partners of the SAC complex (Bub1, Bub3, and BubR1). We also show that TAp73 is involved in SAC protein localization and activities. Moreover, we show that decreased TAp73 expression correlates with increases of SAC protein expression in patients with lung cancer. Our results establish TAp73 as a regulator of SAC responses and indicate that TAp73 loss can lead to mitotic arrest defects. Our data suggest that SAC impairment in the absence of functional TAp73 could explain the genomic instability and increased aneuploidy observed in TAp73-deficient cells.',\n",
              "  'The therapeutical potential of alpha-synuclein antiaggregatory agents for dementia with Lewy bodies. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most frequent cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD), is characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area. Clinically, DLB is distinguished from AD by fluctuating cognition, prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonism, and from Parkinson disease, by the appearance of parkinsonism within one year of cognitive or behavioral decline. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein. Accumulating evidence suggests that its aggregation constitutes one of the first steps preceding Lewy body formation, so that antiaggregation strategies would be very useful to prevent alpha-synuclein fibril formation. Main therapies nevertheless applied up to the present remain symptomatological. In this context, cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil, are used for the treatment of delusions and other psychotic symptoms. This review focuses on the recent discovery of possible alpha-synuclein anti-aggregation factors, where four main classes can be defined. First, beta-synuclein as well as alpha-synuclein derived peptides in addition to antibodies present a group of proteins and peptides that directly interact with alpha-synuclein and so inhibit its aggregation. Second, small molecules interfere with alpha-synuclein aggregation by their covalent binding, although not all of them are suitable for an appropriate inhibition of alpha-synuclein aggregation. Third, to inhibit the expression of alpha-synuclein and its isoforms at the RNA level, the use of interference RNA represents a future challenge.

              "  \"Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase phosphorylates phospholamban and regulates calcium uptake in cardiomyocyte sarcoplasmic reticulum. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of a protein kinase gene (DMPK). Cardiovascular disease is one of the most prevalent causes of death in DM patients. Electrophysiological studies in cardiac muscles from DM patients and from DMPK(-/-) mice suggested that DMPK is critical to the modulation of cardiac contractility and to the maintenance of proper cardiac conduction activity. However, there are no data regarding the molecular signaling pathways involved in DM heart failure. Here we show that DMPK expression in cardiac myocytes is highly enriched in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it colocalizes with the ryanodine receptor and phospholamban (PLN), a muscle-specific SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DMPK and PLN can physically associate. Furthermore, purified wild-type DMPK, but not a kinase-deficient mutant (K110A DMPK), phosphorylates PLN in vitro. Subsequent studies using the DMPK(-/-) mice demonstrated that PLN is hypo-phosphorylated in SR vesicles from DMPK(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Ca(2+) uptake in SR is impaired in ventricular homogenates from DMPK(-/-) mice. Together, our data suggest the existence of a novel regulatory DMPK pathway for cardiac contractility and provide a molecular mechanism for DM heart pathology.\",\n",
              "  'Hypermethylation of the CpG dinucleotide in epidermal growth factor receptor codon 790: implications for a mutational hotspot leading to the T790M mutation in non-small-cell lung cancer. Nearly one half of all cases of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are due to the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20. The T790M mutation is a C→T transition mutation at a CpG dinucleotide. DNA methylation of cytosine (5-methylcytosine (5-mC)) in CpG dinucleotides is a common DNA modification; CpG dinucleotides are considered to be mutational hotspots that cause genetic diseases and cancers through spontaneous deamination of 5-mC, resulting in C→T transition mutations. This study aimed to examine the methylation level of cytosine of EGFR codon 790 and investigate whether DNA methylation was involved in acquiring the T790M mutation. We examined 18 NSCLC tumor tissues, 7 normal lymph node tissues, and 4 NSCLC cell lines (PC9, HCC827, 11-18, and A549). 5-mC was checked by bisulfite sequencing and quantified by pyrosequencing. We found that all tissue samples and cell lines had 5-mC in EGFR codon 790. The 5-mC range was 58.4-90.8%. Our results imply that hypermethylation of the CpG dinucleotide in EGFR codon 790 leads to the C→T transition mutation, causing resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment.',\n",
              "  'Thyroid morphology and subclinical hypothyroidism in children and adolescents with Williams syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To verify the prevalence of morpho-volumetric and functional thyroid abnormalities in young patients with Williams syndrome (WS). STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-two patients with WS (49 boys and 43 girls, 0.2-17.2 years of age) underwent evaluation of thyroid function by means of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), fT3, and fT4 measurement. Thyroid ultrasonography was performed in 37 patients. Thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin) were measured in all patients with abnormal thyroid function tests. RESULTS: None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid antibodies were absent in all patients. The prevalence of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly higher in the younger patients. Ultrasonography revealed morphological or volumetric abnormalities of the thyroid gland in 67.5% of patients; these abnormalities were more frequently observed in the older children. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either with normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function. Therefore, we suggest yearly monitoring of thyroid function and sonographic studies at least once in patients with WS. Treatment should be reserved for the patients with overt hypothyroidism or for those whose thyroid function shows signs of progressive deterioration.',\n",

              "  'Integration of autophagy, proteasomal degradation, unfolded protein response and apoptosis. A single cell has the potential to kill an entire human being. Efforts to cure cancer are limited by survival of individual cancer cells despite immune surveillance and toxic therapies. Understanding the intricate network of pathways that maintain cellular homeostasis and mediate stress response or default into cell death is critical to the development of strategies to eradicate cancer. Autophagy, proteasomal degradation and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are cellular pathways that degrade and recycle excess or damaged proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis and survival. This review will discuss autophagy and how it is integrated with proteasomal degradation and UPR to govern cell fate through restoration of cellular homeostasis or default into the apoptotic cell death pathway. The first response of autophagy is macroautophagy, which sequesters cytoplasm including organelles inside double-membraned autophagosome vesicles that fuse with lysosomes to degrade and recycle the contents. Ubiquitination patterns on proteins targeted for degradation determine whether adapter proteins will bring them to developing autophagosomes or to proteasomes. Macroautophagy is followed by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), in which Hsc70 (Heat shock cognate 70) selectively binds proteins with exposed KFERQ motifs and pushes them inside lysosomes through the LAMP-2A (Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A) receptor. These two processes and the lesser understood microautophagy, which involves direct engulfment of proteins into lysosomes, occur at basal and induced levels. Insufficient proteasome function or ER stress induction of UPR can induce autophagy, which can mitigate damage and stress. If this network is incapable of repairing the damage or overcoming continued stress, the default pathway of apoptosis is engaged to destroy the cell. Induction of macroautophagy by cancer therapeutics has led to clinical trials investigating combinations of HCQ (hydroxychloriquine) suppression of autophagy with apoptosis-inducing agents. Further study of the complex integration of autophagy, proteasomal degradation, UPR and apoptosis is likely to provide additional targets for our fight against cancer.

              "  'BACH1 is a specific repressor of HMOX1 that is inactivated by arsenite. Intracellular heme is a redox active molecule that can be detrimental to cells at high concentrations or under oxidizing conditions. To prevent accumulation, the inducible enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) catalyzes degradation of heme. In the absence of elevated intracellular heme or oxidative stress, the basic region leucine zipper transcriptional regulator BACH1 binds HMOX1 antioxidant response elements and represses transcription. Conversely, increased intracellular heme or sulfhydryl oxidation inactivate BACH1, permitting transcriptional induction of HMOX1. Here, we investigate the effect of BACH1 inactivation on the induction of HMOX1 and as a mechanism for broader gene induction. We show that BACH1 is inactivated at low micromolar arsenite concentrations and that BACH1 inactivation is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional induction of HMOX1. Because BACH1 is thought to interact with antioxidant response element motifs, we further examined the role of BACH1 as a regulator of inducible antioxidant gene expression by assessing the global profile of gene expression following BACH1 knockdown using small interfering RNA. The loss of BACH1 function in human keratinocytes results almost exclusively in HMOX1 induction, suggesting that BACH1 may function as a rheostat regulating levels of intracellular free heme.',\n",
              "  'Gaucher disease: N370S glucocerebrosidase gene frequency in the Portuguese population. In the Portuguese population the most frequent form of Gaucher disease is type 1. The N370S glucocerebrosidase gene mutation accounts for 63% of mutated alleles. The frequency of this mutation was accurately determined in the Portuguese population, which does not present an Ashkenazi Jewish genetic background. A gene frequency of 0.0043, with 95% confidence limits between 0.0023 and 0.0063, was obtained studying the genomic DNA of 2000 blood cards randomly sampled from the national neonatal screening program. On the basis of this frequency a significantly high number of homozygotes for the N370S mutation should be expected in the Portuguese population. This finding supports the idea that the majority of homozygotes for this mutation present a very mild clinical phenotype and remain undiagnosed.',\n",
              "  'The Sestrins interact with GATOR2 to negatively regulate the amino-acid-sensing pathway upstream of mTORC1. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is a major regulator of cell growth that responds to numerous environmental cues. A key input is amino acids, which act through the heterodimeric Rag GTPases (RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD) in order to promote the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. GATOR2 is a complex of unknown function that positively regulates mTORC1 signaling by acting upstream of or in parallel to GATOR1, which is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagA or RagB and an inhibitor of the amino-acid-sensing pathway. Here, we find that the Sestrins, a family of poorly understood growth regulators (Sestrin1-Sestrin3), interact with GATOR2 in an amino-acid-sensitive fashion. Sestrin2-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 signaling requires GATOR1 and the Rag GTPases, and the Sestrins regulate the localization of mTORC1 in response to amino acids. Thus, we identify the Sestrins as GATOR2-interacting proteins that regulate the amino-acid-sensing branch of the mTORC1 pathway.',\n",
              "  'Resveratrol and the pharmacology of aging: a new vertebrate model to validate an old molecule. The natural phytoalexin resveratrol, found in grapes and red wine, recently rose to public fame for its positive effects on longevity in yeasts, worms and flies. Resveratrol anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory in vitro action on mammalian cell cultures also suggest a possible positive effect on human health and life-expectancy. To study the effects of resveratrol on vertebrate aging is obviously a particularly relevant question. We have studied resveratrol effects in a very short-lived vertebrate: the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri. Resveratrol treatment prolonged lifespan and delayed the onset of age-related dysfunctions in this fish. This result identifies resveratrol as the first molecule which consistently retards aging in organisms as diverse as yeast, worm, fly and fish, but it also reveals the potential of this short-lived fish as an animal model for pharmacological research. Moreover, being related to stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) the \"pufferfishes\" Takifugu and Tetraodon, and even more closely related to medaka (Oryzias latipes), it can greatly beneficiate from the recent development of genomic resources for these fish models and in the future become a complete model system for the aging research community.',\n",
              "  \"Mepolizumab: 240563, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, SB 240563. Mepolizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody that is in clinical trials with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for the treatment of severe asthma, nasal polyposis and hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic oesophagitis (the latter two indications are classed as eosinophilia in the phase table). Interleukin-5 stimulates the production, activation and maturation of eosinophils. Since mepolizumab inhibits interleukin-5 and has a long terminal half-life, treatment with mepolizumab causes a sustained reduction in the numbers of circulating eosinophils. Thus, mepolizumab may be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of conditions characterized by increased levels of eosinophils. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare idiopathic disease with broad clinical signs and symptoms that is diagnosed based on a persistent blood eosinophil count of >1500 cells, various end-organ damages (including skin, heart, lung, nervous system and digestive system), and with exclusion of known secondary causes of hypereosinophilia. Mepolizumab is in clinical trials for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome, eosinophilc oesophagitis, severe asthma (in patients with airway eosinophilia) and nasal polyposis. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has completed enrolment in a phase II study of mepolizumab in 20 patients with symptomatic eosinophilic bronchitis with or without asthma in Canada. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is evaluating the effects of intravenous mepolizumab on asthma control, airway eosinophilia and the degree to which concomitant corticosteroid treatment can be reduced (NCT00292877). In previous clinical studies, including trials in the EU and US, mepolizumab has shown a lack of effect on allergen-induced airway responses and inflammation despite a significant reduction in blood and sputum eosinophil levels.A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III study of mepolizumab over 9 months in 85 patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome was completed in 2006. All patients have been offered, and continued in, a phase III, open-label, long-term extension study of mepolizumab. Enrolment in this study was completed in September 2006.A phase III, compassionate use trial of mepalizumab (NCT00244686) in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome was ongoing in October 2007 in the US. Patients who have significant clinical disease but are unresponsive to traditional treatment and those who have demonstrated clinical benefit from previous anti-IL-5 treatment are eligible to take part in the trial. Mepolizumab received orphan drug status for first-line treatment in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome in the US and the EU in 2004. Mepolizumab is also in phase I/II clinical development for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis. A phase I/II trial (NCT00358449) began in August 2006 in the US, Australia, the UK and Canada, and will enrol approximately 72 paediatric patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis. The randomized, parallel-group clinical trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous mepolizumab for 12 weeks. In September 2006, GSK completed enrolment in a phase I/II study of mepolizumab for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis in ten adult patients in Switzerland (NCT00274703). The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of IV mepolizumab.A phase I/II trial of mepolizumab in four patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis conducted by Cincinnati Children's hospital found the monoclonal antibody was safe and effective. Brigham and Women's Hospital in association with GSK is conducting a phase I/II trial of mepolizumab in patients with Churg-Strauss Syndrome (CSS) in the US. The trial, which started in September 2007, will evaluate the potential of mepolizumab to reduce the need for corticosteroid therapy in patients with CSS (NCT00527566). CSS, otherwise known as allergic granulomatosis, is defined by patients with asthma, eosinophilia and vasculitis.\",\n",
              "  'Efficacy and safety of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine with or without a booster dose in infants and children in Africa: final results of a phase 3, individually randomised, controlled trial. BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of the RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine during 18 months of follow-up have been published previously. Herein, we report the final results from the same trial, including the efficacy of a booster dose. METHODS: From March 27, 2009, until Jan 31, 2011, children (age 5-17 months) and young infants (age 6-12 weeks) were enrolled at 11 centres in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) at first vaccination by block randomisation with minimisation by centre to receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01 at months 0, 1, and 2 and a booster dose at month 20 (R3R group); three doses of RTS,S/AS01 and a dose of comparator vaccine at month 20 (R3C group); or a comparator vaccine at months 0, 1, 2, and 20 (C3C [control group]). Participants were followed up until Jan 31, 2014. Cases of clinical and severe malaria were captured through passive case detection. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded. Analyses were by modified intention to treat and per protocol. The coprimary endpoints were the occurrence of malaria over 12 months after dose 3 in each age category. In this final analysis, we present data for the efficacy of the booster on the occurrence of malaria. Vaccine efficacy (VE) against clinical malaria was analysed by negative binomial regression and against severe malaria by relative risk reduction. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00866619. FINDINGS: 8922 children and 6537 young infants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analyses. Children were followed up for a median of 48 months (IQR 39-50) and young infants for 38 months (34-41) after dose 1. From month 0 until study end, compared with 9585 episodes of clinical malaria that met the primary case definition in children in the C3C group, 6616 episodes occurred in the R3R group (VE 36·3%, 95% CI 31·8-40·5) and 7396 occurred in the R3C group (28·3%, 23·3-32·9); compared with 171 children who experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the C3C group, 116 children experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the R3R group (32·2%, 13·7 to 46·9) and 169 in the R3C group (1·1%, -23·0 to 20·5). In young infants, compared with 6170 episodes of clinical malaria that met the primary case definition in the C3C group, 4993 episodes occurred in the R3R group (VE 25·9%, 95% CI 19·9-31·5) and 5444 occurred in the R3C group (18·3%, 11·7-24·4); and compared with 116 infants who experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the C3C group, 96 infants experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the R3R group (17·3%, 95% CI -9·4 to 37·5) and 104 in the R3C group (10·3%, -17·9 to 31·8). In children, 1774 cases of clinical malaria were averted per 1000 children (95% CI 1387-2186) in the R3R group and 1363 per 1000 children (995-1797) in the R3C group. The numbers of cases averted per 1000 young infants were 983 (95% CI 592-1337) in the R3R group and 558 (158-926) in the R3C group. The frequency of SAEs overall was balanced between groups. However, meningitis was reported as a SAE in 22 children: 11 in the R3R group, ten in the R3C group, and one in the C3C group. The incidence of generalised convulsive seizures within 7 days of RTS,S/AS01 booster was 2·2 per 1000 doses in young infants and 2·5 per 1000 doses in children. INTERPRETATION: RTS,S/AS01 prevented a substantial number of cases of clinical malaria over a 3-4 year period in young infants and children when administered with or without a booster dose. Efficacy was enhanced by the administration of a booster dose in both age categories. Thus, the vaccine has the potential to make a substantial contribution to malaria control when used in combination with other effective control measures, especially in areas of high transmission.

              "  \"The emergence of factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases: a patent review. INTRODUCTION: Factor Xa (FXa) is a critical enzyme in the coagulation cascade responsible for thrombin generation, the final enzyme that leads to fibrin clot formation. Significant success has recently been reported with compounds such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and more recently in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). The success these agents have demonstrated is now being reflected by a narrowing of new FXa patents over the past few years. The new patents appear to be structural modifications of previously published, small molecule inhibitors and bind in a similar manner to the FXa enzyme. AREAS COVERED: SciFinder®, PubMed and Google websites were used as the main source of literature retrieval. Patent searches were conducted in the patent databases: HCAPlus, WPIX and the full text databases (USPAT2, USPATFULL, EPFULL, PCTFULL) using the following keywords: ((FXa) OR (F OR factor) (W) (Xa)) (S) (inhibit? or block? or modulat? or antagonist? or regulat?). The search was restricted to patent documents with the entry date on or after 1 January 2009. Literature and information related to clinical development was retrieved from Thomson Reuter's Pharma. EXPERT OPINION: A large body of Phase II and Phase III data is now available for FXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. The clinical data demonstrate favorable benefit-risk profiles compared with the standards of care for short- and long-term anticoagulation (i.e., low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and wafarin). The potential exists that these agents will eventually be the agents of choice for the treatment of a host of cardiovascular disease states, offering improved efficacy, safety, and ease of use compared with existing anticoagulants.\",\n",
              "  'The anti-apoptotic protein HAX-1 is a regulator of cardiac function. The HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that protects cardiomyocytes from programmed cell death. Here we identify HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. Conversely, downregulation of HAX-1 enhanced calcium cycling and contractility. The inhibitory effects of HAX-1 were abolished upon phosphorylation of phospholamban, which plays a fundamental role in controlling basal contractility and constitutes a key downstream effector of the beta-adrenergic signaling cascade. Mechanistically, HAX-1 promoted formation of phospholamban monomers, the active/inhibitory units of the calcium pump. Indeed, ablation of PLN rescued HAX-1 inhibition of contractility in vivo. Thus, HAX-1 represents a regulatory mechanism in cardiac calcium cycling and its responses to sympathetic stimulation, implicating its importance in calcium homeostasis and cell survival.',\n",

Heparins and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) used commonly are the standard treatment of venous and arterial thromboses. They are very efficient and safe, but have some limitations: iatrogenicity, laboratory monitoring, parenteral use for heparins and fondaparinux. Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The objective is to substitute these indirect inhibitors of factor Xa (heparins, low molecular weight heparins and fondaparinux) in the prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic episodes. The new direct inhibitors do not require routine laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation. They inhibit the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are efficacious and safe in the prevention of cerebral infarcts in patients with non-valvular fibrillation. Apixaban is another direct inhibitor of factor Xa used orally which is developed in the same indications as rivaroxaban. Edoxaban and betrixaban are also in development. The objective of this work is to study the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, the efficacy and safety of these four oral direct factor Xa inhibitors.',\n",

INTRODUCTION: The introduction of novel anticoagulants has had contrasting effects on the agents in the pipeline, fueling the development of some and sinking the others. The complexity of the coagulation cascade offers interesting inhibition choices that might become valid treatment options. AREAS COVERED: This review will highlight some of the anticoagulants in the pipeline. Following the success of the direct thrombin and FXa inhibitors already in the market, new agents are being tested. These include AZD0837, betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, and LY517717. Targeting other components of the hemostatic pathway might lead to better safety profiles without influencing efficacy. Inhibitors to FVIIa-tissue factor (FVIIa/TF) complex, FIX, FXI, and FXII are being assessed. New inspiring inhibitors are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and aptamers. These are highly specific agents with readily reversible effect and might be engineered to inhibit any coagulation factor. Currently tested ASOs and aptamers are inhibitors of FXI, FXII, thrombin, FIXa, and platelet GPIV. EXPERT OPINION: Some of the agents in the pipeline offer valid treatment option for long-term therapy, overcoming some of the drawbacks of the novel anticoagulants. Research is being driven by an expanding market in the anticoagulation field that has been unexploited for a long time.',\n",
              "  'Human bone marrow stroma cells display certain neural characteristics and integrate in the subventricular compartment after injection into the liquor system. Because the neural differentiation capacity of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is still a matter of controversial debate, we performed a thorough investigation into the differentiation capacity of human BMSCs and examined their therapeutic potency. BMSCs were isolated from the femur and kept in cell cultures with various cultivation protocols being applied. In standard culture conditions using a fetal calf serum-enriched medium, while not exhibiting a neural phenotype, the majority of cells expressed a variety of neuronal marker proteins as well as the astrocyte marker GFAP. Only a minority of stem cells expressed nestin, a marker for neural precursor cells. Cultivation in serum-free medium supplemented with specific growth factors resulted in a markedly higher percentage of nestin-positive cells. To establish the therapeutic potency of bone marrow-derived cells, the synthesis of neurotrophic factors such as NGF, BDNF and GDNF was analyzed under non-stimulating standard culture conditions as well as after a neural selection procedure. The therapeutic potency of BMSCs was further examined with regard to their migratory potential in vitro and after transplantation in vivo. After stereotactic engraftment into the lateral ventricle of adult rats, mesenchymal stem cells were seen to adhere to the ependymocytes and cells of the choroids plexus. Afterwards grafted cells passed through the ependymal barrier, locating in the subventricular space. Their BMSCs took up a close host graft interaction without any degenerative influence on the host cells. Furthermore, there was morphological as well as immunohistochemical evidence for a transdifferentiation within the host tissue. In addition, BMSCs could be efficiently transduced using a third-generation adenoviral vector, indicating their potential feasibility for a gene-therapeutic option.',\n",

We investigated the expression of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) and the functional role of NCX in retinal damage by using NCX1-heterozygous deficient mice (NCX1(+/-)) and SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy] phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline), a selective NCX inhibitor in vivo. We also examined the role of NCX in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stress with a retinal ganglion cell line (RGC-5) cell culture in vitro. The expression of NCX1 was confirmed and entirely localized in retina by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. NCX1(+/-) mice possessed significant protection against retinal damage induced by intravitreal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). SEA0400 at 3 and 10 mg/kg significantly reduced NMDA- or high intraocular pressure-induced retinal cell damage in mice. Furthermore, SEA0400 reduced the number of TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling)-positive cells and the expression of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2, JNK, p38) induced by NMDA injection. In RGC-5, SEA0400 at 0.3 and 1 microM significantly inhibited OGD-induced cell damage. OGD-induced cell damage was aggravated by ouabain (a Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) at 100 microM, and this increased damage was significantly reduced by SEA0400 at 1 microM. In conclusion, these results suggest that NCX1 may play a role in retinal cell death induced by NMDA and ischemia-reperfusion.',\n",

              "  'Endoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps and cancer. Endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis is involved in a multitude of signaling, as well as \"house-keeping\" functions that control cell growth, differentiation or apoptosis in every human/eukaryotic cell. Calcium is actively accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum by Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium transport ATPases (SERCA enzymes). SERCA-dependent calcium transport is the only calcium uptake mechanism in this organelle, and therefore the regulation of SERCA function by the cell constitutes a key mechanism to adjust calcium homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum depending on the cell type and its state of differentiation. The direct pharmacological modulation of SERCA activity affects cell differentiation and survival. SERCA expression levels can undergo significant changes during cell differentiation or tumorigenesis, leading to modified endoplasmic reticulum calcium storage. In several cell types such as cells of hematopoietic origin or various epithelial cells, two SERCA genes (SERCA2 and SERCA3) are simultaneously expressed. Expression levels of SERCA3, a lower calcium affinity calcium pump are highly variable. In several cell systems SERCA3 expression is selectively induced during differentiation, whereas during tumorigenesis and blastic transformation SERCA3 expression is decreased. These observations point at the existence of a cross-talk, via the regulation of SERCA3 levels, between endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis and the control of cell differentiation, and show that endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis itself can undergo remodeling during differentiation. The investigation of the anomalies of endoplasmic reticulum differentiation in tumor and leukemia cells may be useful for a better understanding of the contribution of calcium signaling to the establishment of malignant phenotypes.',\n",
              "  'Differential response of p53 target genes to p73 overexpression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. p73, the first p53 gene homologue, encodes an array of p73 proteins including p73 alpha full-length (TAp73 alpha) and amino-truncated isoforms (Delta Np73 alpha), two proteins with opposite biological functions. TAp73 alpha can induce tumor suppressive properties, while Delta Np73 alpha antagonizes p53 as well as TAp73 in a dominant-negative manner. In human malignant neuroblasts, p53 protein is wild-type but known to be excluded from the nucleus, therefore disabling its function as a tumor suppressor. The present study investigates whether there is a functional link between p73 isoforms and p53 in neuroblastoma. Experiments were performed on two neuroblastoma cell lines differing in their p53 status, e.g. wild-type p53 SH-5Y5Y cells and mutated p53 IGR-N-91 cells. Data indicate that (i) both TA- and Delta N-p73 alpha enhance p53 protein level in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas level remains unchanged in IGR-N-91 cells; (ii) only in SH-SY5Y cells does forced TAp73 alpha overexpression markedly induce nuclear accumulation of p53 protein; (iii) p21 protein expression is increased in both cell lines infected with TAp73, suggesting that, in IGR-N-91 cells, p21 is induced by p73 through a p53-independent pathway; (iv) in the SHSY5Y cell line, Btg2 expression is strongly enhanced in cells overexpressing TA, and to a lesser extent in cells overexpressing Delta N. Taken together our results suggest that TAp73 may restore p53 function in NB with wild-type nonfunctional p53, but not in NB with mutated p53.',\n",
              "  'The specific Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor SEA0400 prevents nitric oxide-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays a role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, causes apoptotic-like cell death in cultured glial cells via NCX-mediated pathways and the mechanism for NO-induced cytotoxicity is cell type-dependent. The present study examined using the specific NCX inhibitor 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) whether NCX is involved in NO-induced injury in cultured neuronal cells. The treatment of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with SNP resulted in apoptosis and the cytotoxicity was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase inhibitor U0126 and the p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580, but not by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP60012. SNP increased Ca(2+) influx and intracellular Ca(2+) levels. In addition, SNP increased ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These effects of SNP were prevented by SEA0400. SNP-induced cytotoxicity was not affected by inhibitors of the Ca(2+), Na(+) and store-operated/capacitative channels. Moreover, SNP-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels, ROS production and decrease in cell viability were blocked by a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor. These results suggest that Ca(2+) influx via the reverse of NCX is involved in the cascade of NO-induced neuronal apoptosis and NO activates the NCX through guanylate cyclase/PKG pathway.',\n",
              "  'SEA0400, a novel and selective inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, attenuates reperfusion injury in the in vitro and in vivo cerebral ischemic models. The effect of the newly synthesized compound 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) on the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) was investigated and compared against that of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). In addition, the effects of SEA0400 on reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo were examined. SEA0400 was extremely more potent than KB-R7943 in inhibiting Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in cultured neurons, astrocytes, and microglia: IC50s of SEA0400 and KB-R7943 were 5 to 33 nM and 2 to 4 microM, respectively. SEA0400 at the concentration range that inhibited NCX exhibited negligible affinities for the Ca2+ channels, Na+ channels, K+ channels, norepinephrine transporter, and 14 receptors, and did not affect the activities of the Na+/H+ exchanger, Na+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and five enzymes. SEA0400, unlike KB-R7943, did not inhibit the store-operated Ca2+ entry in cultured astrocytes. SEA0400 attenuated dose- dependently paradoxical Ca2+ challenge-induced production of reactive oxygen species, DNA ladder formation, and nuclear condensation in cultured astrocytes, whereas it did not affect thapsigargin-induced cell injury. Furthermore, administration of SEA0400 reduced infarct volumes after a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rat cerebral cortex and striatum. These results indicate that SEA0400 is the most potent and selective inhibitor of NCX, and suggest that the compound may exert protective effects on postischemic brain damage.',\n",
              "  'Familial associations in medullary thyroid carcinoma with Hirschsprung disease: the role of the RET-C620 \"Janus\" genetic variation. INTRODUCTION: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is associated with the later development of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2), because RET gene variations are associated with both conditions. Specifically, HSCR-MEN2 cosegregation mostly relates to the cysteine-rich area at the RET-620 (the \"Janus gene\"). AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical and genetic associations of HSCR-MEN2 in a cohort of HSCR patients. METHODS: RET gene variation was evaluated by heteroduplex single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and validated with automated sequencing techniques in HSCR patients (including 18 kindreds). Those with RET C620 variations were subjected to familial evaluation for coexisting HSCR-MEN2. RESULTS: A cohort of 118 patients with HSCR (n = 89) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (n = 29) were studied, including 3 families where a RET-620 point mutation was identified. No C618, C609, or C611 variations were detected. In 1 remarkable 6-generational family (family 3), HSCR in early generations seemed to be later replaced by MEN2A. In the other 2 families with total colonic aganglionosis, a relative with a medullary thyroid carcinoma was identified. CONCLUSION: Gene mutation in the RET-620 position carries significant risk and may be part of a targeted investigation of high-risk areas in HSCR. We propose an alternative hypothesis of endoplasmic reticulum control to explain the changing phenotypic expression.',\n",
              "  \"Delayed L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia. Previously we reported on L-DOPA's antinociceptive effect on substance P-induced nociceptive behaviors in mice [Shimizu T, Iwata S, Morioka H, Masuyama T, Fukuda T, Nomoto M. Antinociceptive mechanism of L-DOPA. Pain 2004;110;246-9.]. Since significant hyperalgesia was noted following antinociception, our study was designed to investigate the mechanism of this hyperalgesia. Nociceptive behaviors were enhanced 2 h after L-DOPA administration. L-DOPA induced hyperalgesia occurred after conversion to dopamine because co-administration of benserazide, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, completely abolished the L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia. The D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, depressed these behaviors entirely, while the D1 antagonist, SCH23390, inhibited the enhancement of these behaviors by L-DOPA. The D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride, which induced hyperalgesia of the substance P-induced behaviors in naive mice, did not have any effects on L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia. Spinal cord dopamine content increased rapidly after L-DOPA administration, exhibiting levels 100 times greater than baseline, and then returned to control after 1 h. These results suggested that the dopaminergic inhibitory system for pain sensation was temporarily impaired by excess amounts of exogenous dopamine that were derived from L-DOPA and both D1 and D2 receptors were involved in L-DOPA-induced hyperalgesia.\",\n",
              "  'Thyroid anomalies in Williams syndrome: investigation of 95 patients. Thyroid involvement in Williams syndrome (WS) was recently reported in two small groups of patients, both showing an increased prevalence of elevation of TSH serum concentration; in one of the two reports, 70% of the patients demonstrated a hypoplasia of thyroid gland as well. In our institution, we currently follow a large population of WS patients who periodically undergo a multispecialist clinical evaluation that includes ultrasound evaluation of the thyroid gland, and levels of FT3, FT4, TSH, and anti-thyroid antibodies. Here, we report on the prevalence of thyroid structural and functional anomalies, in a population of 95 WS patients, half of them followed for more than 5 years. Our study confirms the increased incidence of both elevated TSH serum values (37.9% in our sample) and thyroid gland hypoplasia (74.7%). Moreover, we demonstrated that TSH elevation declines with age. For this reason, we suggest that a complete thyroid evaluation be performed in every patient with WS, and that this medical complication should be periodically searched for in follow-up visits.',\n",
              "  'A clinical trial of escalating doses of flumazenil for reversal of suspected benzodiazepine overdose in the emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if flumazenil, when used in doses higher than those currently recommended, could reverse the effects of a benzodiazepine (BDZ) overdose in patients who might not otherwise respond and whether the higher dose was associated with increased adverse effects. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced, with parallel groups. Open-label flumazenil administration was available if a patient failed to respond or became resedated. SETTING: Sixteen emergency departments in the United States. POPULATION: Patients presenting to the ED with clinically significant signs and symptoms of a known or suspected BDZ overdose. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive 10 mL/min of placebo or flumazenil (1 mg/10 mL) each minute for ten minutes. If there was no response, up to 3 mg of open-label flumazenil could be administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 170 patients enrolled, 87 received flumazenil and 83 received placebo. The demographic characteristics of both groups were comparable. Ten minutes after the beginning of study drug infusion, patients were evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC), and Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale (NAS). The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P < .01). There was no difference in the mean CGIS score between the flumazenil (3.25 +/- 1.15) and placebo (3.75 +/- 0.69) groups in BDZ-negative patients. The GCS and NAS were also significantly better in patients who were BDZ-positive and received flumazenil. The mean +/- SD dose of flumazenil administered during the double-blind phase was 71.3 +/- 34.2 mL (7.13 mg) compared with 95.06 +/- 16.03 mL of placebo. Of the 39 patients who had BDZ-positive drug screens and received flumazenil, 29 (74%) responded to 3 mg or less. Six additional patients responded to 4 or 5 mg, and one patient responded to 8 mg. The most common adverse effects in patients who received flumazenil were injection site pain (10.3%), agitation (8%), vomiting (3.4%), dizziness (3.4%), headache (3.4%), tachycardia (3.4%), and crying (3.4%). Three patients developed seizures. Two were associated with significant tricyclic antidepressant overdoses and one with propoxyphene ingestion. Two patients had positive drug screens for BDZ. CONCLUSION: Flumazenil rapidly and effectively reverses the clinical signs and symptoms of a BDZ overdose. Most patients will respond to 3 mg or less, but a small number may require a higher dose for reversal of clinical symptoms. Patients with concomitant tricyclic antidepressant overdose may be at risk for developing seizures.',\n",
              "  'Functional analysis of Rfx6 and mutant variants associated with neonatal diabetes. Mutations in rfx6 were recently associated with Mitchell-Riley syndrome, which involves neonatal diabetes, and other digestive system defects. To better define the function of Rfx6 in early endoderm development we cloned the Xenopus homologue. Expression of rfx6 begins early, showing broad expression throughout the anterior endoderm; at later stages rfx6 expression becomes restricted to the endocrine cells of the gut and pancreas. Morpholino knockdown of rfx6 caused a loss of pancreas marker expression, as well as other abnormalities. Co-injection of exogenous wild-type rfx6 rescued the morpholino phenotype in Xenopus tadpoles, whereas attempts to rescue the loss-of-function phenotype using mutant rfx6 based on Mitchell-Riley patients were unsuccessful. To better define the pleiotropic effects, we performed microarray analyses of gene expression in knockdown foregut tissue. In addition to pancreatic defects, the microarray analyses revealed downregulation of lung, stomach and heart markers and an upregulation of kidney markers. We verified these results using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Based on the different rfx6 expression patterns and our functional analyses, we propose that rfx6 has both early and late functions. In early development Rfx6 plays a broad role, being essential for development of most anterior endodermal organs. At later stages however, Rfx6 function is restricted to endocrine cells.',\n",

Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a high-throughput method for transcriptome analysis that provides a single base-pair resolution map of transcription start sites (TSS) and their relative usage. Despite their high resolution and functional significance, published CAGE data are still underused in promoter analysis due to the absence of tools that enable its efficient manipulation and integration with other genome data types. Here we present CAGEr, an R implementation of novel methods for the analysis of differential TSS usage and promoter dynamics, integrated with CAGE data processing and promoterome mining into a first comprehensive CAGE toolbox on a common analysis platform. Crucially, we provide collections of TSSs derived from most published CAGE datasets, as well as direct access to FANTOM5 resource of TSSs for numerous human and mouse cell/tissue types from within R, greatly increasing the accessibility of precise context-specific TSS data for integrative analyses.

              "  'Inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The pathogenesis of RA is a complex and ever-changing landscape but amid the chaos of the disease process we have found effective treatment regimes. However, our current therapeutics, although targeting various components of both the innate and adaptive immune response, do not result in disease remission. Protein kinase inhibitors are attractive targets due to their ability to influence downstream signalling and their oral bioavailability. Fostamatinib (R788) inhibits spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and has been in clinical trials involving both MTX inadequate responders (MTX-IRs) and biologic inadequate responders. Studies on the MTX-IR population revealed ACR20 responses of 67-72% at higher doses (150 mg bd and 100 mg bd), ACR50 responses of 43-57% and ACR70 responses of 28-40%. The trial in the biologic non-responder population showed no efficacy, however, post hoc analyses of the data suggested that a further trial in this population is warranted. The most common adverse events included gastrointestinal effects, hypertension, neutropenia and transaminitis. Many adverse effects were dose responsive and hypertension was amenable to treatment. Upper respiratory tract infections were more likely at higher doses, but no serious infections with tuberculosis, fungi or opportunistic infections were reported. The oral availability of these agents makes them attractive treatment options for our patients, although the literature from the oncology field suggests that patients will only choose the oral route if efficacy is equivalent. Long-term follow-up studies are ongoing and will be critical for rare side effects. The role of these agents in our current arsenal is unclear and economic analyses are awaited.',\n",
              "  'Understanding the role of the Josephin domain in the PolyUb binding and cleavage properties of ataxin-3. Ataxin-3, the disease protein in the neurodegenerative disorder Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 or Machado Joseph disease, is a cysteine protease implicated in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. It contains multiple ubiquitin binding sites through which it anchors polyubiquitin chains of different linkages that are then cleaved by the N-terminal catalytic (Josephin) domain. The properties of the ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs) in the C-terminus of ataxin-3 are well established. Very little is known, however, about how two recently identified ubiquitin-binding sites in the Josephin domain contribute to ubiquitin chain binding and cleavage. In the current study, we sought to define the specific contribution of the Josephin domain to the catalytic properties of ataxin-3 and assess how the topology and affinity of these binding sites modulate ataxin-3 activity. Using NMR we modeled the structure of diUb/Josephin complexes and showed that linkage preferences are imposed by the topology of the two binding sites. Enzymatic studies further helped us to determine a precise hierarchy between the sites. We establish that the structure of Josephin dictates specificity for K48-linked chains. Site 1, which is close to the active site, is indispensable for cleavage. Our studies open the way to understand better the cellular function of ataxin-3 and its link to pathology.',\n",

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterised by the occurrence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (9/22 translocation) and the formation of a fusion protein--the BCR-ABL transcript with constitutive activation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and consequent changes in the intracellular signal transduction, which is responsible for the deregulated myeloid cell proliferation. STI571 (signal transduction inhibition number 571) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. In the chronic phase of the disease, normal peripheral blood values are achieved within the first month of treatment in the large majority of patients and in many patients also a cytogenic response within the following months. The results in the advanced phase are far less favourable, which is explained by the development of resistance owing to reactivation of the BCR-ABL signal transduction. Side effects are primarily nausea, vomiting, various rashes, oedema, most often in the periorbital region, and musculoskeletal symptoms, including muscle cramps. Perspectives for treatment with STI571 are described, as are combinations with alpha-interferon and other cytostatics with a synergistic profile.',\n",

Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common of the lysosomal storage disorders and is caused by defects in the GBA gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GlcCerase). The accumulation of its substrate, glucocylceramide (GlcCer) is considered the main cause of GD. We found here that the expression of human mutated GlcCerase gene (hGBA) that is associated with neuronopathy in GD patients causes neurodevelopmental defects in Drosophila eyes. The data indicate that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was elevated in Drosophila eye carrying mutated hGBAs by using of the ER stress markers dXBP1 and dBiP. We also found that Ambroxol, a potential pharmacological chaperone for mutated hGBAs, can alleviate the neuronopathic phenotype through reducing ER stress. We demonstrate a novel mechanism of neurodevelopmental defects mediated by ER stress through expression of mutants of human GBA gene in the eye of Drosophila.',\n",

Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations within the insulin binding domain of the human insulin receptor (INSR) are usually associated with severe impairment of insulin binding leading to Donohue syndrome (\"Leprechaunism\"), which is characterized by excessive hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinism, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, distinct dysmorphism and early death. Missense mutations in the beta subunits are commonly associated with a milder impairment of insulin binding and milder phenotype with prolonged survival and less dysmorphism, the so called Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. We report on a 13-year-old girl with Donohue syndrome like dysmorphism, hyperinsulinism and prolonged survival due to two novel INSR missense mutations within the insulin binding domain. Unexpectedly, insulin binding assays and investigations of activation of central insulin signaling pathways in fibroblasts revealed no significant alterations. Instead, immunofluorescence studies showed abnormal perinuclear distribution of the INSR alpha and beta subunits. Our data indicate that the quality of insulin binding activity is correlated with survival, not with the dysmorphic phenotype, and it is not always a valid parameter for predicting INSR mutations as proposed.',\n",
              "  'Emerging interest in the kallikrein gene family for understanding and diagnosing cancer. Kallikreins are proteolytic enzymes that constitute a subfamily of serine proteases. Novel kallikrein genes were cloned recently, and it was shown that the human kallikrein family contains 15 genes tandemly aligned on chromosomal locus 19q13.3-q13.4. Based on their altered expression in tumor cells, kallikreins may be involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of cancer. Evidence is presented that certain kallikreins may be exploited as diagnostic cancer biomarkers. Although the function(s) of novel kallikreins is currently unknown, increasing evidence suggests that kallikreins may participate in regulatory enzymatic cascade(s). Elucidation of the function of novel kallikreins largely depends on the availability of active recombinant proteins. Here, the zymogen for kallikrein 13 was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris and biochemically characterized. It was shown that the kallikrein 13 zymogen displays intrinsic catalytic activity leading to autoactivation. A clipped form of kallikrein 13 was identified, indicating autocatalytic cleavage at the internal bond R114-S115. Mature kallikrein 13 displays trypsin-like activity with restricted specificity on synthetic and protein substrates. Combinatorial P1-Lys libraries of tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrates were synthesized and used for the profiling of the P2 specificity of selected kallikreins. Interestingly, it was shown that human kallikrein 13, similarly to PSA, could specifically cleave human plasminogen to generate angiostatin-like fragments, suggesting that specific kallikreins may have antiangiogenic actions. An understanding of the physiology of human kallikreins is emerging with potential clinical applications.',\n",

The mitochondrial cytochrome c-557 of Crithidia oncopelti contains two lysine residues and an N-terminal proline residue that are methylated in vivo by the methyl group of methionine. The purified cytochrome can act as a methyl acceptor for a methyltransferase activity in the cell extract that uses S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor. Crithidia cytochrome c-557 is by far the best substrate for this methyltransferase of those tested, in spite of the fact that methylation sites are already almost fully occupied. The radioactive uptake of [14C]methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine occurred only at a lysine residue (-8) and the N-terminal proline residue. This methyltransferase appears to differ from that of Neurospora and yeast [Durban, Nochumson, Kim, Paik & Chan (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 1427-1435; DiMaria, Polastro, DeLange, Kim & Paik (1979) J.

GV1001 is a 16-amino-acid vaccine peptide derived from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence. We investigated the effects of GV1001 against β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in rat neural stem cells (NSCs). Primary culture NSCs were treated with several concentrations of GV1001 and/or Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer for 48 hours. GV1001 protected NSCs against the Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in a concentration-dependent manner. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ concentration dependently decreased viability, proliferation, and mobilization of NSCs and GV1001 treatment restored the cells to wild-type levels. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ increased free radical levels in rat NSCs while combined treatment with GV1001 significantly reduced these levels. In addition, GV1001 treatment of Aβ₂₅₋₃₅-injured NSCs increased the expression level of survival-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated survival proteins, and decreased the levels of death and inflammation-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated death proteins. Together, these results suggest that GV1001 possesses neuroprotective effects against Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in NSCs and that these effects are mediated through mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, including the induction of cellular proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects, mitochondrial stabilization, and anti-aging and anti-oxidant effects.',\n",
              "  'Gangliosidoses. The gangliosidoses comprise a family of lysosomal storage diseases characterized by the accumulation of complex glycosphingolipids in the nervous system and other tissues, secondary to the deficient activity of lysosomal hydrolases or their associated activator proteins. GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis are associated with deficiency of β-galactosidase and β-hexosaminidase respectively. All gangliosidoses are characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, the severity of which is proportional to the residual enzyme activity. The GM1 gangliosidoses are characterized by dysostosis, organomegaly and coarsening in their most severe forms, whereas children with classic infantile GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease) are usually spared systemic involvement, except in the case of the Sandhoff variant, in which organomegaly may occur. Cherry-red macular spots occur in the early onset forms of the gangliosidoses, but are less frequently seen in the less severe, later onset phenotypes. Macrocephaly, an exaggerated startle response, cognitive decline, seizures, ataxia, and progressive muscular atrophy may occur in different forms of gangliosidosis. The diagnosis is made by assay of enzyme activity, and can be confirmed by mutation analysis. Carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease has been remarkably successful in reducing the incidence of this disease in the at-risk Ashkenazi population. There are no proven disease-modifying therapies for the gangliosidoses.',\n",

The rationale for selection of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) as the target antigen and the preclinical development history of the vaccine are described. The RTS,S/AS candidate vaccine has been evaluated in multiple phase I/II studies and was shown to have a favorable safety profile and to be well tolerated in both adults and children. Consistent and significant efficacy has been observed in the target population of infants and children against Plasmodium falciparum infection and disease in different transmission settings, in different age groups, with or without Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) vaccine co-administration. The RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria vaccine candidate has recently entered phase III testing. Reaching this important milestone is the culmination of more than 20 years of research and development by GlaxoSmithKline, their partners and collaborators.

              "  \"The anti-apoptotic protein HAX-1 interacts with SERCA2 and regulates its protein levels to promote cell survival. Cardiac contractility is regulated through the activity of various key Ca(2+)-handling proteins. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation. Recently, the antiapoptotic HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a binding partner of PLN, and this interaction was postulated to regulate cell apoptosis. In the current study, we determined that HAX-1 can also bind to SERCA2. Deletion mapping analysis demonstrated that amino acid residues 575-594 of SERCA2's nucleotide binding domain are required for its interaction with the C-terminal domain of HAX-1, containing amino acids 203-245. In transiently cotransfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, recombinant SERCA2 was specifically targeted to the ER, whereas HAX-1 selectively concentrated at mitochondria. On triple transfections with PLN, however, HAX-1 massively translocated to the ER membranes, where it codistributed with PLN and SERCA2. Overexpression of SERCA2 abrogated the protective effects of HAX-1 on cell survival, after hypoxia/reoxygenation or thapsigargin treatment. Importantly, HAX-1 overexpression was associated with down-regulation of SERCA2 expression levels, resulting in significant reduction of apparent ER Ca(2+) levels. These findings suggest that HAX-1 may promote cell survival through modulation of SERCA2 protein levels and thus ER Ca(2+) stores.\",\n",

The Na(+)/Ca(2+)exchanger (NCX) principal function is taking 1 Ca(2+) out of the cytoplasm and introducing 3 Na(+). The increase of cytoplasmic Na(+) concentration induces the NCX reverse mode (NCX(REV)), favoring Ca(2+) influx. NCX(REV) can be inhibited by: KB-R7943 a non-specific compound that blocks voltage-dependent and store-operated Ca(2+) channels; SEA0400 that appears to be selective for NCX(REV), but difficult to obtain and SN-6, which efficacy has been shown only in cardiomyocytes. We found that PPADS, a P2X receptor antagonist, acts as a NCX(REV) inhibitor in guinea pig tracheal myocytes. In these cells, we characterized the NCX(REV) by substituting NaCl and NaHCO(3) with LiCl, resulting in the increase of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) using fura 2-AM. We analyzed 5 consecutive responses of the NCX(REV) every 10 min, finding no differences among them. To evaluate the effect of different NCX(REV) blockers, concentration response curves to KB-R7943 (1, 3.2 and 10 μM), and SN-6 (3.2, 10 and 30 μM) were constructed, whereas PPADS effect was characterized as time- and concentration-dependent (1, 3.2, 10 and 30 μM). PPADS had similar potency and efficacy as KB-R7943, whereas SN-6 was the least effective. Furthermore, KCl-induced contraction, sensitive to D600 and nifedipine, was blocked by KB-R7943, but not by PPADS. KCl-induced [Ca(2+)]i increment in myocytes was also significantly decreased by KBR-7943 (10 μM). Our results demonstrate that PPADS can be used as a reliable pharmacological tool to inhibit NCX(REV), with the advantage that it is more specific than KB-R7943 because it does not affect L-type Ca(2+) channels.',\n",
              "  'Ancient duplicated conserved noncoding elements in vertebrates: a genomic and functional analysis. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. Although most of these elements share little sequence identity to each other, a small number are remarkably similar and appear to be the product of duplication events. Here, we searched for duplicated conserved noncoding elements in the human genome, using comparisons with Fugu to select putative cis-regulatory sequences. We identified 124 families of duplicated elements, each containing between two and five members, that are highly conserved within and between vertebrate genomes. In 74% of cases, we were able to assign a specific set of paralogous genes with annotation relating to transcriptional regulation and/or development to each family, thus removing much of the ambiguity in identifying associated genes. We find that duplicate elements have the potential to up-regulate reporter gene expression in a tissue-specific manner and that expression domains often overlap, but are not necessarily identical, between family members. Over two thirds of the families are conserved in duplicate in fish and appear to predate the large-scale duplication events thought to have occurred at the origin of vertebrates. We propose a model whereby gene duplication and the evolution of cis-regulatory elements can be considered in the context of increased morphological diversity and the emergence of the modern vertebrate body plan.',\n",
              "  'A clinical trial of escalating doses of flumazenil for reversal of suspected benzodiazepine overdose in the emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if flumazenil, when used in doses higher than those currently recommended, could reverse the effects of a benzodiazepine (BDZ) overdose in patients who might not otherwise respond and whether the higher dose was associated with increased adverse effects. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced, with parallel groups. Open-label flumazenil administration was available if a patient failed to respond or became resedated. SETTING: Sixteen emergency departments in the United States. POPULATION: Patients presenting to the ED with clinically significant signs and symptoms of a known or suspected BDZ overdose. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive 10 mL/min of placebo or flumazenil (1 mg/10 mL) each minute for ten minutes. If there was no response, up to 3 mg of open-label flumazenil could be administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 170 patients enrolled, 87 received flumazenil and 83 received placebo. The demographic characteristics of both groups were comparable. Ten minutes after the beginning of study drug infusion, patients were evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC), and Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale (NAS). The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P < .01). There was no difference in the mean CGIS score between the flumazenil (3.25 +/- 1.15) and placebo (3.75 +/- 0.69) groups in BDZ-negative patients. The GCS and NAS were also significantly better in patients who were BDZ-positive and received flumazenil. The mean +/- SD dose of flumazenil administered during the double-blind phase was 71.3 +/- 34.2 mL (7.13 mg) compared with 95.06 +/- 16.03 mL of placebo. Of the 39 patients who had BDZ-positive drug screens and received flumazenil, 29 (74%) responded to 3 mg or less. Six additional patients responded to 4 or 5 mg, and one patient responded to 8 mg. The most common adverse effects in patients who received flumazenil were injection site pain (10.3%), agitation (8%), vomiting (3.4%), dizziness (3.4%), headache (3.4%), tachycardia (3.4%), and crying (3.4%). Three patients developed seizures. Two were associated with significant tricyclic antidepressant overdoses and one with propoxyphene ingestion. Two patients had positive drug screens for BDZ. CONCLUSION: Flumazenil rapidly and effectively reverses the clinical signs and symptoms of a BDZ overdose. Most patients will respond to 3 mg or less, but a small number may require a higher dose for reversal of clinical symptoms. Patients with concomitant tricyclic antidepressant overdose may be at risk for developing seizures.',\n",

              "  'Detection of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in lung cancer by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. BACKGROUND: Two types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in exon 19 and exon 21 (ex19del and L858R) are prevalent in lung cancer patients and sensitive to targeted EGFR inhibition. A resistance mutation in exon 20 (T790M) has been found to accompany drug treatment when patients relapse. These three mutations are valuable companion diagnostic biomarkers for guiding personalized treatment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based methods have been widely used in the clinic by physicians to guide treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical and clinical sensitivity and specificity of the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method in detecting the three EGFR mutations in patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Genomic DNA from H1975 and PC-9 cells, as well as 92 normal human blood specimens, was used to determine the technical sensitivity and specificity of the ddPCR assays. Genomic DNA of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 78 Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma were assayed using both qPCR and ddPCR. RESULTS: The three ddPCR assays had a limit of detection of 0.02% and a wide dynamic range from 1 to 20,000 copies measurement. The L858R and ex19del assays had a 0% background level in the technical and clinical settings. The T790M assay appeared to have a 0.03% technical background. The ddPCR assays were robust for correct determination of EGFR mutation status in patients, and the dynamic range appeared to be better than qPCR methods. The ddPCR assay for T790M could detect patient samples that the qPCR method failed to detect. About 49% of this patient cohort had EGFR mutations (L858R, 15.4%; ex19del, 29.5%; T790M, 6.4%). Two patients with the ex19del mutation also had a naïve T790M mutation. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the ddPCR method could be useful in the personalized treatment of patients with lung cancer.',\n",
              "  'Assembly and iron-binding properties of human frataxin, the protein deficient in Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive degenerative disease caused by a deficiency of frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein of unknown function. Mitochondrial iron accumulation, loss of iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes and increased oxidative damage occur in yeast and mouse frataxin-depleted mutants as well as tissues and cell lines from FRDA patients, suggesting that frataxin may be involved in export of iron from the mitochondria, synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters and/or protection from oxidative damage. We have previously shown that yeast frataxin has structural and functional features of an iron storage protein. In this study we have investigated the function of human frataxin in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When expressed in E.coli, the mature form of human frataxin assembles into a stable homopolymer that can bind approximately 10 atoms of iron per molecule of frataxin. The iron-loaded homopolymer can be detected on non-denaturing gels by either protein or iron staining demonstrating a stable association between frataxin and iron. As analyzed by gel filtration and electron microscopy, the homopolymer consists of globular particles of approximately 1 MDa and ordered rod-shaped polymers of these particles that accumulate small electron-dense cores. When the human frataxin precursor is expressed in S.cerevisiae, the mitochondrially generated mature form is separated by gel filtration into monomer and a high molecular weight pool of >600 kDa. A high molecular weight pool of frataxin is also present in mouse heart indicating that frataxin can assemble under native conditions. In radiolabeled yeast cells, human frataxin is recovered by immunoprecipitation with approximately five atoms of (55)Fe bound per molecule. These findings suggest that FRDA results from decreased mitochondrial iron storage due to frataxin deficiency which may impair iron metabolism, promote oxidative damage and lead to progressive iron accumulation.',\n",
              "  'Heme: a versatile signaling molecule controlling the activities of diverse regulators ranging from transcription factors to MAP kinases. Heme (iron protoporphyrin IX) is an essential molecule for numerous living organisms. Not only does it serve as a prosthetic group in enzymes, it also acts as a signaling molecule that controls diverse molecular and cellular processes ranging from signal transduction to protein complex assembly. Deficient heme synthesis or function impacts the hematopoietic, hepatic and nervous systems in humans. Recent studies have revealed a series of heme-regulated transcription factors and signal transducers including Hap1, a heme-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of oxygen on gene transcription in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Bach1, a transcriptional repressor that is negatively regulated by heme in mammalian cells; IRR, an iron regulatory protein that mediates the iron-dependant regulation of heme synthesis in the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum; and heme-regulated inhibitor, an eucaryotic initiation factor 2alpha kinase that coordinates protein synthesis with heme availability in reticulocytes. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about how heme controls the activity of these transcriptional regulators and signal transducers, and discuss diseases associated with defective heme synthesis, degradation and function.',\n",
              "  'Overcoming endocrine therapy resistance by signal transduction inhibition. Endocrine therapy is the most effective systemic treatment for patients with hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer. Unfortunately, efficacy is often limited by the onset of resistance, which is almost inevitable for patients with advanced disease. Several patterns of endocrine resistance are recognizable clinically, including: A) tumors that are inherently insensitive to all attempts at estrogen receptor (ER) targeting despite expression of ER (pan-endocrine therapy resistance); B) tumors that are estrogen dependent but resistant to one or more specific endocrine therapies (agent-selective resistance); and C) tumors that initially respond but subsequently progress (acquired resistance). Current insights into the molecular basis for these resistance patterns are rudimentary, but are most clearly illuminated by investigations that focus on the crosstalk between the ErbB or HER peptide growth factor family and the ER. The data are sufficiently compelling to be addressed by ongoing clinical trials that examine combinations of endocrine agents and either trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, Inc.; South San Francisco, CA) or ErbB-specific tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors. Preliminary data from a small \"proof of concept\" phase II study of letrozole (Femara; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; East Hanover, NJ) and trastuzumab demonstrated durable responses despite tamoxifen (Nolvadex; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals; Wilmington, DE) resistance. Efficacy was variable, however, despite the selection of patients on the basis of ER and ErbB-2 coexpression. Complicating matters further, resistance often occurs in the absence of any evidence for ErbB TK family member expression. In the absence of a clear target, common downstream signal transduction proteins that are known to intersect with the ER pathway can be inhibited to address resistance, including G proteins with farnesyltransferase inhibitors and molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) with rapamycin analogues. With a number of phase III clinical trials now under way, major advances in the endocrine treatment of advanced disease are possible.',\n",

The aim of this study was to assess the morphology and distribution of alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in cases of dementia with LB (DLB), and to compare alpha-synuclein with ubiquitin immunostaining. We examined substantia nigra, paralimbic regions (entorhinal cortex, cingulate gyrus, insula and hippocampus), and neocortex (frontal and occipital association cortices) with double alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin immunostaining in 25 cases meeting neuropathological criteria for DLB. alpha-Synuclein immunostaining was more specific than ubiquitin immunostaining in that it differentiated LB from globose tangles. It was also slightly more sensitive, staining 4-5% more intracytoplasmic structures, especially diffuse alpha-synuclein deposits that were ubiquitin negative. In addition to LB, alpha-synuclein staining showed filiform and globose neurites in the substantia nigra, CA2-3 regions of the hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. A spectrum of alpha-synuclein staining was seen in substantia nigra: from diffuse \"cloud-like\" inclusions to aggregated intracytoplasmic inclusions with variable ubiquitin staining to classic LB. We hypothesize that these represent different stages in LB formation.',\n",
              "  'Histone acetylation controls the inactive X chromosome replication dynamics. In mammals, dosage compensation between male and female cells is achieved by inactivating one female X chromosome (Xi). Late replication of Xi was proposed to be involved in the maintenance of its silenced state. Here, we show a highly synchronous replication of the Xi within 1 to 2 h during early-mid S-phase by following DNA replication in living mammalian cells with green fluorescent protein-tagged replication proteins. The Xi was replicated before or concomitant with perinuclear or perinucleolar facultative heterochromatin and before constitutive heterochromatin. Ectopic expression of the X-inactive-specific transcript (Xist) gene from an autosome imposed the same synchronous replication pattern. We used mutations and chemical inhibition affecting different epigenetic marks as well as inducible Xist expression and we demonstrate that histone hypoacetylation has a key role in controlling Xi replication. The epigenetically controlled, highly coordinated replication of the Xi is reminiscent of embryonic genome replication in flies and frogs before genome activation and might be a common feature of transcriptionally silent chromatin.',\n",
              "  'Ca2+ binding to site I of the cardiac Ca2+ pump is sufficient to dissociate phospholamban. Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca(2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+). Recent cross-linking studies have suggested that PLB binding and Ca(2+) binding to SERCA2a are mutually exclusive. PLB binds to the E2 conformation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, preventing formation of E1, the conformation that binds two Ca(2+) (at sites I and II) with high affinity and is required for ATP hydrolysis. Here we determined whether Ca(2+) binding to site I, site II, or both sites is sufficient to dissociate PLB from the Ca(2+) pump. Seven SERCA2a mutants with amino acid substitutions at Ca(2+)-binding site I (E770Q, T798A, and E907Q), site II (E309Q and N795A), or both sites (D799N and E309Q/E770Q) were made, and the effects of Ca(2+) on N30C-PLB cross-linking to Lys(328) of SERCA2a were measured. In agreement with earlier reports with the skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase, none of the SERCA2a mutants (except E907Q) hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of Ca(2+); however, all were phosphorylatable by P(i) to form E2P. Ca(2+) inhibition of E2P formation was observed only in SERCA2a mutants retaining site I. In cross-linking assays, strong cross-linking between N30C-PLB and each Ca(2+)-ATPase mutant was observed in the absence of Ca(2+). Importantly, however, micromolar Ca(2+) inhibited PLB cross-linking only to mutants retaining a functional Ca(2+)-binding site I. The dynamic equilibrium between Ca(2+) pumps and N30C-PLB was retained by all mutants, demonstrating normal regulation of cross-linking by ATP, thapsigargin, and anti-PLB antibody. From these results we conclude that site I is the key Ca(2+)-binding site regulating the physical association between PLB and SERCA2a.',\n",
              "  'Myocardial protection against pressure overload in mice lacking Bach1, a transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase-1. Bach1 is a stress-responsive transcriptional factor that is thought to control the expression levels of cytoprotective factors, including heme-oxygenase (HO)-1. In the present study, we investigated the roles of Bach1 in the development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in vivo using Bach1 gene-deficient (Bach1(-/-)) mice. TAC for 3 weeks in wild-type control (Bach1(+/+)) mice produced LV hypertrophy and remodeling manifested by increased heart weight, histological findings showing increased myocyte cross-sectional area (CSA) and interstitial fibrosis (picro Sirius red staining), reexpressions of ANP, BNP, and betaMHC genes, and echocardiographic findings showing wall thickening, LV dilatation, and reduced LV contraction. Deletion of Bach1 caused significant reductions in heart weight (by 16%), CSA (by 36%), tissue collagen content (by 38%), and gene expression levels of ANP (by 75%), BNP (by 45%), and betaMHC (by 74%). Echocardiography revealed reduced LV dimension and ameliorated LV contractile function. Deletion of Bach1 in the LV caused marked upregulation of HO-1 protein accompanied by elevated HO activity in both basal or TAC-stimulated conditions. Treatment of Bach1(-/-) mice with tin-protoporphyrin, an inhibitor of HO, abolished the antihypertrophic and antiremodeling effects of Bach1 gene ablation. These results suggest that deletion of Bach1 caused upregulation of cytoprotective HO-1, thereby inhibiting TAC-induced LV hypertrophy and remodeling, at least in part, through activation of HO. Bach1 repressively controls myocardial HO-1 expression both in basal and stressed conditions, inhibition of Bach1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy to protect the myocardium from pressure overload.',\n",
              "  'Restoration of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex after exon skipping therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i.m.) injection. We now show that this dystrophin expression was accompanied by an elevated expression of α-sarcoglycan, β-dystroglycan (BDG) and--in relevant cases--neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at the sarcolemma, each of which is a component of a different subcomplex of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC). As expected, nNOS expression was relocalized to the sarcolemma in Duchenne patients in whom the dystrophin deletion left the nNOS-binding domain (exons 42-45) intact, whereas this did not occur in patients with deletions that involved this domain. Our results indicate that the novel internally deleted and shorter dystrophin induced by skipping exon 51 in patients with amenable deletions, can also restore the dystrophin-associated complex, further suggesting preserved functionality of the newly translated dystrophin.',\n",
              "  'Genetic and molecular aspects of acromelic dysplasia. The acromelic dysplasia group includes three rare disorders: Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) and Acromicric dysplasia (AD) all characterized by short stature, short hands and stiff joints. The clinical overlap between the three disorders is striking. Indeed, in addition to the diagnostic criteria, they all share common features including delayed bone age, cone shaped epiphyses, thick skin and heart disease. In contrast, a microspherophakic lens seems to be a characteristic feature of WMS whereas hepatomegaly and a severe outcome are encountered only in the most severe forms of GD. Finally, WMS is transmitted either by an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance, GD by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and AD by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Using genetic approaches, we have identified the molecular basis of WMS and GD which both involved the same superfamily of proteins, the ADAMTS [A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase domain (reprolysin type) with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats (TSR)]. We have found ADAMTS10 mutations in the recessive form of WMS and Fibrillin 1 mutations in the dominant form of WMS. More recently, we have identified ADAMTSL2 mutations in GD. The function of ADAMTS1 0 and AD AMTSL 2 are unknown. But the findings of FBN1 and ADAMTS10 mutations in WMS suggest a direct link between the two proteins. Using a yeast double hybrid screen, we have identified LTBP1 (Latent TGFbeta Binding protein 1) as a partner of ADAMTSL2. The combination of these findings suggests that ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2 are both involved in the microfibrillar network.',\n",

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common, clinically significant, cardiac arrhythmia affects 1% of the general population and has important hemodynamic and thromboembolic complications that contribute to elevated morbidity and mortality. AF increases the overall risk of stroke five-fold, accounting for approximately 15% of all strokes and is associated with particularly severe stroke. For the last 50 years, long-term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists has been the most effective therapy for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with AF and other risk factors, but their use has a lot of limitations and drawbacks (frequent monitoring and dose adjustment, food and drug interactions, delayed onset of action etc). Nowadays, new oral anticoagulants have emerged that seem to overcome those limitations. Direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have proven, in large, multicenter, randomized, phase III, clinical studies, to be at least as efficient as warfarin in stroke prevention in patients with AF. RELY and ROCKET AF trials have contributed to market approval of dabigatran and rivaroxaban, respectively and made them available to clinical practice. Another factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is under evaluation in an ongoing phase III clinical trial and others such as AZD0837, betrixaban and darexaban are still in safety and tolerability phase II studies. The oral anticoagulation landscape is changing rapidly and these new agents seem to be very promising. However future post-marketing studies and registries will help clarify their efficacy and safety.',\n",
              "  'Characterization and functional expression of cDNAs encoding methionine-sensitive and -insensitive homocysteine S-methyltransferases from Arabidopsis. Plants synthesize S-methylmethionine (SMM) from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and methionine (Met) by a unique reaction and, like other organisms, use SMM as a methyl donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine (Hcy). These reactions comprise the SMM cycle. Two Arabidopsis cDNAs specifying enzymes that mediate the SMM --> Met reaction (SMM:Hcy S-methyltransferase, HMT) were identified by homology and authenticated by complementing an Escherichia coli yagD mutant and by detecting HMT activity in complemented cells. Gel blot analyses indicate that these enzymes, AtHMT-1 and -2, are encoded by single copy genes. The deduced polypeptides are similar in size (36 kDa), share a zinc-binding motif, lack obvious targeting sequences, and are 55% identical to each other. The recombinant enzymes exist as monomers. AtHMT-1 and -2 both utilize l-SMM or (S,S)-AdoMet as a methyl donor in vitro and have higher affinities for SMM. Both enzymes also use either methyl donor in vivo because both restore the ability to utilize AdoMet or SMM to a yeast HMT mutant. However, AtHMT-1 is strongly inhibited by Met, whereas AtHMT-2 is not, a difference that could be crucial to the control of flux through the HMT reaction and the SMM cycle. Plant HMT is known to transfer the pro-R methyl group of SMM. This enabled us to use recombinant AtHMT-1 to establish that the other enzyme of the SMM cycle, AdoMet:Met S-methyltransferase, introduces the pro-S methyl group. These opposing stereoselectivities suggest a way to measure in vivo flux through the SMM cycle.',\n",
              "  \"A novel insight into the mechanism of mammalian selenoprotein synthesis. The amino acid selenocysteine is encoded by UGA, usually a stop codon, thus requiring a specialized machinery to enable its incorporation into selenoproteins. The machinery comprises the tRNA(Sec), a 3'-UTR mRNA stem-loop termed SElenoCysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS), which is mandatory for recoding UGA as a Sec codon, the SECIS Binding Protein 2 (SBP2), and other proteins. Little is known about the molecular mechanism and, in particular, when, where, and how the SECIS and SBP2 contact the ribosome. Previous work by others used the isolated SECIS RNA to address this question. Here, we developed a novel approach using instead engineered minimal selenoprotein mRNAs containing SECIS elements derivatized with photoreactive groups. By cross-linking experiments in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, new information could be gained about the SBP2 and SECIS contacts with components of the translation machinery at various translation steps. In particular, we found that SBP2 was bound only to the SECIS in 48S pre-initiation and 80S pretranslocation complexes. In the complex where the Sec-tRNA(Sec) was accommodated to the A site but transpeptidation was blocked, SBP2 bound the ribosome and possibly the SECIS element as well, and the SECIS had flexible contacts with the 60S ribosomal subunit involving several ribosomal proteins. Altogether, our findings led to broadening our understanding about the unique mechanism of selenocysteine incorporation in mammals.\",\n",
              "  'Inhibition by adriamycin of calmodulin-sensitive and phospholipid-sensitive calcium-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous proteins from heart. Adriamycin, a lipid-interacting anti-cancer agent, was found to inhibit phospholipid-sensitive Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous proteins from the cytosol of the guinea-pig heart. The drug, unexpectedly, also inhibited phosphorylation of separate endogenous proteins in the cardiac cytosol and membranes catalysed by the calmodulin-sensitive species of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase. In both phosphorylation systems, the inhibition by adriamycin was reversed by either phospholipid (phosphatidylserine or cardiolipin) or calmodulin respectively. Adriamycin also inhibited phosphorylation of histone (exogenous protein) catalysed by purified cardiac phospholipid-sensitive Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, but not that by cyclic AMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases. It appears that Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation systems, regulated either by phospholipid or calmodulin, may represent hitherto unrecognized sites of action of adriamycin. It remains to be seen whether inhibition by adriamycin of these systems is related to the severe cardiotoxicity, the major adverse effect of the drug that limits its clinical usefulness.',\n",

Sec is inserted by a specific translational machinery that recognizes a stem-loop structure, the SECIS element, at the 3' UTR of selenoprotein genes and recodes a UGA codon within the coding sequence. As UGA is normally a translational stop signal, selenoproteins are generally misannotated and designated tools have to be developed for this class of proteins. Here, we present two new computational methods for selenoprotein identification and analysis, which we provide publicly through the web servers at http://gladyshevlab.org/SelenoproteinPredictionServer or http://seblastian.crg.es. SECISearch3 replaces its predecessor SECISearch as a tool for prediction of eukaryotic SECIS elements. Seblastian is a new method for selenoprotein gene detection that uses SECISearch3 and then predicts selenoprotein sequences encoded upstream of SECIS elements. Seblastian is able to both identify known selenoproteins and predict new selenoproteins. By applying these tools to diverse eukaryotic genomes, we provide a ranked list of newly predicted selenoproteins together with their annotated cysteine-containing homologues.

OBJECT: Meningiomas treated by subtotal or partial resection are associated with significantly shorter recurrence-free survival than those treated by gross-total resection. The Simpson grading system classifies incomplete resections into a single category, namely Simpson Grade IV, with wide variations in the volume and location of residual tumors, making it complicated to evaluate the achievement of surgical goals and predict the prognosis of these tumors. Authors of the present study investigated the factors related to necessity of retreatment and tried to identify any surgical nuances achievable with the aid of modern neurosurgical techniques for meningiomas treated using Simpson Grade IV resection. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included patients with WHO Grade I meningiomas treated using Simpson Grade IV resection as the initial therapy at the University of Tokyo Hospital between January 1995 and April 2010. Retreatment was defined as reresection or stereotactic radiosurgery due to postoperative tumor growth. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were included in this study. Regrowth of residual tumor was observed in 22 patients with a mean follow-up period of 6.1 years. Retreatment was performed for 20 of these 22 tumors with regrowth. Risk factors related to significantly shorter retreatment-free survival were age younger than 50 years (p = 0.006), postresection tumor volume of 4 cm(3) or more (p = 0.016), no dural detachment (p = 0.001), and skull base location (p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis revealed that no dural detachment (hazard ratio [HR] 6.42, 95% CI 1.41-45.0; p = 0.02) and skull base location (HR 11.6, 95% CI 2.18-218; p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for the necessity of early retreatment, whereas postresection tumor volume of 4 cm(3) or more was not a statistically significant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with Simpson Grade I, II, and III resections, Simpson Grade IV resection includes highly heterogeneous tumors in terms of resection rate and location of the residual mass. Despite the difficulty in analyzing such diverse data, these results draw attention to the favorable effect of dural detachment (instead of maximizing the resection rate) on long-term tumor control. Surgical strategy with an emphasis on detaching the tumor from the affected dura might be another important option in resection of high-risk meningiomas not amenable to gross-total resection.',\n",
              "  'Parallel overexpression of seven kallikrein genes in ovarian cancer. Recent evidence suggests that many members of the human kallikrein (KLK) gene family are differentially regulated in ovarian cancer and have potential as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers. We used the serial analysis of gene expression and expressed sequence tag databases of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project to perform in silico analyses of the expression pattern of the 15 human KLK genes in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues and cell lines. We found that seven KLK genes (KLK5, KLK6, KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK14) are up-regulated in ovarian cancer. Probing 2 normal and 10 ovarian cancer serial analysis of gene expression libraries with gene-specific tags for each KLK indicated that whereas no expression was detected in any normal libraries (with the exception of KLK10 and KLK11), these KLKs were found to be expressed with moderate densities (103-408 tags per million) in 40-60% of the ovarian cancer libraries analyzed. These data were verified by screening the expressed sequence tag databases, where 78 of 79 mRNA clones isolated for these genes were from ovarian cancer libraries. X-profiler comparison of the pools of normal and cancerous ovaries identified a significant difference in expression levels for six of the seven KLKs. We experimentally verified the overexpression of six KLK proteins in cancer versus normal or benign tissues with highly sensitive and specific immunofluorometric assays. A statistically significant stepwise increase in protein levels was found among normal, benign, and cancerous ovarian tissues. The expression of five KLKs showed a strong degree of correlation at the protein level, suggesting the existence of a common mechanism or pathway that controls the expression of this group of adjacent genes during ovarian cancer progression.',\n",
              "  'MLL core components give the green light to histone methylation. Trimethylation of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) is associated with transcriptional activation. One of the chief effectors of H3K4 methylation is mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), a gene that is disrupted by chromosomal translocation in acute leukemia and a master regulator of Hox and other genes. In a recent paper, core components of the human MLL histone methyltransferase (MT) complex were found to form a structural platform, with one component (WDR5) mediating association between the specific histone H3K4 substrate and the MT. This novel regulatory mechanism, which is conserved from yeast to human, is required for both methylation and downstream target gene transcription.',\n",
              "  '[Progress in molecular chorea diagnosis. McLeod syndrome and chorea acanthocytosis]. McLeod syndrome and chorea-acanthocytosis are classified with the so-called neuroacanthocytosis group of syndromes. Both lead to progressive basal ganglia degeneration and were not easily distinguished in the past. With the discovery of their molecular bases, mutations of the X-linked gene XK and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene coding for chorein, respectively, the two phenotypes can now be differentiated and extend the diagnostic spectrum in patients presenting with chorea. The present review compares the two conditions and proposes a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment. Better-defined disease concepts should eventually replace the umbrella term of \"neuroacanthocytosis.\" Animal models are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. A final common pathway is likely for the pathogenesis of these conditions and is most probably shared with Huntington\\'s disease.',\n",
              "  'BRCA1, PARP1 and γH2AX in acute myeloid leukemia: Role as biomarkers of response to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Olaparib (AZD-2281, Ku-0059436) is an orally bioavailable and well-tolerated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor currently under investigation in patients with solid tumors. To study the clinical potential of olaparib as a single-agent for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, we analyzed the in vitro sensitivity of AML cell lines and primary blasts. Clinically achievable concentrations of olaparib were able to induce cell death in the majority of primary AML case samples (88%) and tested cell lines. At these concentrations, olaparib preferentially killed leukemic blasts sparing normal lymphocytes derived from the same patient and did not substantially affect the viability of normal bone marrow and CD34-enriched peripheral blood cells obtained from healthy donors. Most primary AML analyzed were characterized by low BRCA1 mRNA level and undetectable protein expression that likely contributed to explain their sensitivity to olaparib. Noteworthy, while PARP1 over-expression was detected in blasts not responsive to olaparib, phosphorylation of the histone H2AFX (γH2AX) was associated with drug sensitivity. As to genetic features of tested cases the highest sensitivity was shown by a patient carrying a 11q23 deletion. The high sensitivity of AML blasts and the identification of biomarkers potentially able to predict response and/or resistance may foster further investigation of olaparib monotherapy for AML patients unfit to conventional chemotherapy.',\n",
              "  'A phase 1 study of a chimeric monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6, siltuximab, combined with docetaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. PURPOSE: Siltuximab is a chimeric, anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody with potential therapeutic benefit in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. We assessed the safety and tolerability of siltuximab in combination with docetaxel, the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel alone and with siltuximab, and the efficacy and pharmacodynamics of siltuximab plus docetaxel. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, phase 1 study, patients with metastatic, progressive CRPC received docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3w plus siltuximab 6 mg/kg q2w (n=12), 9 mg/kg q3w (n=12), or 12 mg/kg q3w (n=15). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), PSA, and radiologic response according to WHO criteria were evaluated. RESULTS: DLT was reported in 1 of 11 patients receiving 6 mg/kg, 1 of 12 receiving 9 mg/kg, and in 1 of 14 receiving 12 mg/kg. Common Grade > 3 adverse events were neutropenia (73 %), leukopenia (60 %), lymphopenia (30 %), dyspnea (19 %), and fatigue (14 %). Toxicities were not dose dependent. Siltuximab did not affect docetaxel pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic profile for siltuximab in combination was similar to single-agent siltuximab pharmacokinetics. Twenty-three (62 %; 95 % CI 45 %, 78 %) of 37 combination-treated patients achieved a confirmed > 50 % PSA decline. Of 17 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 2 confirmed and 2 unconfirmed radiologic partial responses ranging 190 to 193 days were achieved with 9- and 12-mg/kg siltuximab. C-reactive protein concentrations were suppressed throughout treatment in all patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that siltuximab in combination with docetaxel is safe and shows preliminary efficacy in patients with CRPC, although alternative siltuximab schedules may be better tolerated for future studies.',\n",
              "  'Deletion of the CSB homolog, RAD26, yields Spt(-) strains with proficient transcription-coupled repair. It has been previously shown that disruption of RAD26 in yeast strain W303-1B results in a strain that is deficient in transcription-coupled repair (TCR), the preferential repair of the transcribed strand of an expressed gene over the non-transcribed strand and the rest of the genome. RAD26 encodes a protein that is homologous to Cockayne syndrome group B protein (CSB) and is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases involved in chromatin remodeling. Like the rad26 mutant, cells from Cockayne syndrome patients are defective in TCR. We examined the role of Rad26 in TCR by disrupting RAD26 in two repair-proficient laboratory strains and, remarkably, observed no effect upon TCR. Our results indicate that disruption of RAD26 alone is insufficient to impair TCR. Thus, W303-1B must already possess a mutation that, together with disruption of RAD26, causes a deficiency in TCR. We suggest that other genes are mutated in Cockayne syndrome cells that contribute to the deficiency in TCR. Surprisingly, deletion of RAD26 results in expression of genes that are repressed by flanking transposon delta elements, an Spt(-) phenotype. The delta elements appear to perturb local chromatin structure. Expression of genes flanked by delta elements in rad26Delta mutants is consistent with a role for Rad26 in chromatin remodeling.',\n",

Epidemiologic studies dating from the 1950s established its association with gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly small bowel lymphoma. Corrao et al. recently demonstrated that patients with celiac disease are at increased risk of mortality. Further, this risk is directly related to compliance with a gluten-free diet. Continued research is needed regarding the development of malignant complications related to celiac disease.',\n",
              "  'When hepatoma rupture happens in situs inversus totalis: side matters. The authors reported a 73-year-old alcoholic man with previously-unrecognized situs inversus totalis suffering from left upper quadrant pain. Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed and coronary angioplasty was performed immediately. However, the massive bleeding from the previously-unfound hepatomas caused hypovolemic shock and fatal outcome. Situs inversus totalis is a rare congenital anomaly with a complete mirror image of the thoracic and abdominal organs. Although being considered a benign entity, it would disturb diagnosis-making of the visceral diseases owing to the altered anatomy. To our knowledge, the coexistence of the coronary artery disease and ruptured hepatomas in situs inversus totalis, as in our patient, is never described. Recognition of any situs anomalies in time is the key to avoid misdiagnosis, inappropriate managements, and unwanted consequences.',\n",
              "  'Evolution of the sex-related locus and genomic features shared in microsporidia and fungi. BACKGROUND: Microsporidia are obligate intracellular, eukaryotic pathogens that infect a wide range of animals from nematodes to humans, and in some cases, protists. The preponderance of evidence as to the origin of the microsporidia reveals a close relationship with the fungi, either within the kingdom or as a sister group to it. Recent phylogenetic studies and gene order analysis suggest that microsporidia share a particularly close evolutionary relationship with the zygomycetes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we expanded this analysis and also examined a putative sex-locus for variability between microsporidian populations. Whole genome inspection reveals a unique syntenic gene pair (RPS9-RPL21) present in the vast majority of fungi and the microsporidians but not in other eukaryotic lineages. Two other unique gene fusions (glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase and ubiquitin-ribosomal subunit S30) that are present in metazoans, choanoflagellates, and filasterean opisthokonts are unfused in the fungi and microsporidians. One locus previously found to be conserved in many microsporidian genomes is similar to the sex locus of zygomycetes in gene order and architecture. Both sex-related and sex loci harbor TPT, HMG, and RNA helicase genes forming a syntenic gene cluster. We sequenced and analyzed the sex-related locus in 11 different Encephalitozoon cuniculi isolates and the sibling species E. intestinalis (3 isolates) and E. hellem (1 isolate). There was no evidence for an idiomorphic sex-related locus in this Encephalitozoon species sample. According to sequence-based phylogenetic analyses, the TPT and RNA helicase genes flanking the HMG genes are paralogous rather than orthologous between zygomycetes and microsporidians. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and support the classification of microsporidia as unusual derived fungi. And the sex/sex-related loci appear to have been subject to frequent gene conversion and translocations in microsporidia and zygomycetes.',\n",

The molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) is central to a complex intracellular signaling pathway and is involved in diverse processes including cell growth and proliferation, angiogenesis, autophagy, and metabolism. Although sirolimus (rapamycin), the oldest inhibitor of mTOR, was discovered more than 30 years ago, renewed interest in this pathway is evident by the numerous rapalogs recently developed. These newer agents borrow from the structure of sirolimus and, although there are some pharmacokinetic differences, they appear to differ little in terms of pharmacodynamic effects and overall tolerability. Given the multitude of potential applications for this class of agents and the decrease in cost that can be expected upon the expiration of sirolimus patents, renewed focus on this agent is warranted.',\n",
              "  'Redox regulation of the transcriptional repressor Bach1. Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase-1, one of the most inducible phase 2 proteins. Bach1 binds in conjunction with a small Maf protein to tandem repeats of the antioxidant response element (ARE) and quenches the target gene expression. On the other hand, the transactivator Nrf2 binds and up-regulates the ARE-governed gene expression. By using a sulfhydryl oxidizing agent, diamide, here we provide evidence which indicates that the Bach1 function is regulated by the redox state. Diamide showed restricted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and ARE-driven reporter activity but reversed the ARE transcriptional activity suppressed by ectopically expressed Bach1. Substitution of the conserved cysteine residue in the DNA binding domain of Bach1 to serine (C574S mutant) caused a refractory response to the diamide-mediated reactivation of the Bach1-suppressed reporter activity. Moreover, diamide induced cytoplasmic translocation of the GFP-Bach1 fusion protein but failed to translocate the fusion protein consisting of the C574S mutant. These data suggest that redox regulation of Bach1 is an alternative mechanism to induce multiple ARE-governed genes.',\n",
              "  'Expression of DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of the facial, shoulder and upper arm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is an autosomal dominant disease linked to chromosome 4q35, but the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leading candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is extremely low in FSHD muscle, and there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low levels of human DUX4 in zebrafish development recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalities such as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, developmental abnormality of fin muscle, disorganization of facial musculature and/or degeneration of trunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant localization of myogenic cells marked with α-actin promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside somite boundary, especially in head region. These abnormalities were rescued by coinjection of the short form of DUX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, even at extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FSHD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also propose that DUX4 expression during development is important for the pathogenesis of FSHD.',\n",
              "  'Emerging anticoagulants. Warfarin, heparin and their derivatives have been the traditional anticoagulants used for prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism. While the modern clinician is familiar with the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these agents, their adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development of newer anticoagulants with improved safety, ease of administration, more predictable pharmacodynamics and comparable efficacy. Research into haemostasis and the coagulation cascade has made the development of these newer anticoagulants possible. These drugs include the factor Xa inhibitors and IIa (thrombin) inhibitors. Direct and indirect factor Xa inhibitors are being developed with a relative rapid onset of action and stable pharmacokinetic profiles negating the need for close monitoring; this potentially makes them a more attractive option than heparin or warfarin. Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban. Examples of indirect factor Xa inhibitors include fondaparinux, idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux. Direct thrombin inhibitors (factor IIa inhibitors) were developed with the limitations of standard heparin and warfarin in mind. Examples include recombinant hirudin (lepirudin), bivalirudin, ximelagatran, argatroban, and dabigatran etexilate. This review will discuss emerging novel anticoagulants and their use for the prophylaxis and management of venous thromboembolism, for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and for coronary artery disease.',\n",
              "  'Developmental delays consistent with cochlear hypothyroidism contribute to failure to develop hearing in mice lacking Slc26a4/pendrin expression. Mutations of SLC26A4 cause an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, nonsyndromic deafness, and deafness as part of Pendred syndrome. SLC26A4 encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger located in the cochlea, thyroid, and kidney. The goal of the present study was to determine whether developmental delays, possibly mediated by systemic or local hypothyroidism, contribute to the failure to develop hearing in mice lacking Slc26a4 (Slc26a4(-/-)). We evaluated thyroid function by voltage and pH measurements, by array-assisted gene expression analysis, and by determination of plasma thyroxine levels. Cochlear development was evaluated for signs of hypothyroidism by microscopy, in situ hybridization, and quantitative RT-PCR. No differences in plasma thyroxine levels were found in Slc26a4(-/-) and sex-matched Slc26a4(+/-) littermates between postnatal day 5 (P5) and P90. In adult Slc26a4(-/-) mice, the transepithelial potential and the pH of thyroid follicles were reduced. No differences in the expression of genes that participate in thyroid hormone synthesis or ion transport were observed at P15, when plasma thyroxine levels peaked. Scala media of the cochlea was 10-fold enlarged, bulging into and thereby displacing fibrocytes, which express Dio2 to generate a cochlear thyroid hormone peak at P7. Cochlear development, including tunnel opening, arrival of efferent innervation at outer hair cells, endochondral and intramembraneous ossification, and developmental changes in the expression of Dio2, Dio3, and Tectb were delayed by 1-4 days. These data suggest that pendrin functions as a HCO3- transporter in the thyroid, that Slc26a4(-/-) mice are systemically euthyroid, and that delays in cochlear development, possibly due to local hypothyroidism, lead to the failure to develop hearing.',\n",
              "  'The MCT8 thyroid hormone transporter and Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. Thyroid hormone is essential for the proper development and function of the brain. The active form of thyroid hormone is T(3), which binds to nuclear receptors. Recently, a transporter specific for T(3), MCT8 (monocarboxylate transporter 8) was identified. MCT8 is highly expressed in liver and brain. The gene is located in Xq13 and mutations in MCT8 are responsible for an X-linked condition, Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). This syndrome is characterized by congenital hypotonia that progresses to spasticity with severe psychomotor delays. Affected males also present with muscle hypoplasia, generalized muscle weakness, and limited speech. Importantly, these patients have elevated serum levels of free T(3), low to below normal serum levels of free T(4), and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone that are within the normal range. This constellation of measurements of thyroid function enables quick screening for AHDS in males presenting with cognitive impairment, congenital hypotonia, and generalized muscle weakness.',\n",

INTRODUCTION: In the last few years, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been synthesized and become available for preclinical studies and clinical trials. This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties, and clinical activity and toxicity, as well as the emerging role of TKIs in lymphoid malignancies, allergic diseases, and autoimmune disorders. AREAS COVERED: A literature review was conducted of the MEDLINE database PubMed for articles in English. Publications from 2000 through January 2012 were scrutinized. The search terms used were Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitors, PCI-32765, GDC-0834, LFM-A13, AVL-101, AVL-292, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitors, R343, R406, R112, R788, fostamatinib, BAY-61-3606, C-61, piceatannol, Lyn, imatinib, nilotinib, bafetinib, dasatinib, GDC-0834, PP2, SU6656 in conjunction with lymphoid malignancy, NHL, CLL, autoimmune disease, allergic disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. Conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and ACR/ARHP Annual Scientific Meetings were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. EXPERT OPINION: The use of TKIs, especially inhibitors of Btk, Syk, and Lyn, is a promising new strategy for targeted treatment of B-cell lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune disorders and allergic diseases. However, definitive data from ongoing and future clinical trials will aid in better defining the status of TKIs in the treatment of these disorders.\",\n",
              "  'Explaining intermediate filament accumulation in giant axonal neuropathy. Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN)(1) is a rare autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by mutations in the GAN gene that encodes gigaxonin, a member of the BTB/Kelch family of E3 ligase adaptor proteins.(1) This disease is characterized by the aggregation of Intermediate Filaments (IF)-cytoskeletal elements that play important roles in cell physiology including the regulation of cell shape, motility, mechanics and intra-cellular signaling. Although a range of cell types are affected in GAN, neurons display the most severe pathology, with neuronal intermediate filament accumulation and aggregation; this in turn causes axonal swellings or \"giant axons.\" A mechanistic understanding of GAN IF pathology has eluded researchers for many years. In a recent study(1) we demonstrate that the normal function of gigaxonin is to regulate the degradation of IF proteins via the proteasome. Our findings present the first direct link between GAN mutations and IF pathology; moreover, given the importance of IF aggregations in a wide range of disease conditions, our findings could have wider ramifications.',\n",
              "  'Designing calcium release channel inhibitors with enhanced electron donor properties: stabilizing the closed state of ryanodine receptor type 1. New drugs with enhanced electron donor properties that target the ryanodine receptor from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (RyR1) are shown to be potent inhibitors of single-channel activity. In this article, we synthesize derivatives of the channel activator 4-chloro-3-methyl phenol (4-CmC) and the 1,4-benzothiazepine channel inhibitor 4-[-3{1-(4-benzyl) piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine (K201, JTV519) with enhanced electron donor properties. Instead of activating channel activity (~100 μM), the 4-methoxy analog of 4-CmC [4-methoxy-3-methyl phenol (4-MmC)] inhibits channel activity at submicromolar concentrations (IC(50) = 0.34 ± 0.08 μM). Increasing the electron donor characteristics of K201 by synthesizing its dioxole congener results in an approximately 16 times more potent RyR1 inhibitor (IC(50) = 0.24 ± 0.05 μM) compared with K201 (IC(50) = 3.98 ± 0.79 μM). Inhibition is not caused by an increased closed time of the channel but seems to be caused by an open state block of RyR1. These alterations to chemical structure do not influence the ability of these drugs to affect Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase type 1. Moreover, the FKBP12 protein, which stabilizes RyR1 in a closed configuration, is shown to be a strong electron donor. It seems as if FKBP12, K201, its dioxole derivative, and 4-MmC inhibit RyR1 channel activity by virtue of their electron donor characteristics. These results embody strong evidence that designing new drugs to target RyR1 with enhanced electron donor characteristics results in more potent channel inhibitors. This is a novel approach to the design of new, more potent drugs with the aim of functionally modifying RyR1 single-channel activity.',\n",
              "  'Non-viral reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells by Sleeping Beauty and piggyBac transposons. The generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells represents a promising approach for innovative cell therapies. The original method requires viral transduction of several reprogramming factors, which may be associated with an increased risk of tumorigenicity. Transposition of reprogramming cassettes represents a recent alternative to viral approaches. Since binary transposons can be produced as common plasmids they provide a safe and cost-efficient alternative to viral delivery methods. Here, we compared the efficiency of two different transposon systems, Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB), for the generation of murine iPS. Murine fibroblasts derived from an inbred BL/6 mouse line carrying a pluripotency reporter, Oct4-EGFP, and fibroblasts derived from outbred NMRI mice were employed for reprogramming. Both transposon systems resulted in the successful isolation of murine iPS cell lines. The reduction of the core reprogramming factors to omit the proto-oncogene c-Myc was compatible with iPS cell line derivation, albeit with reduced reprogramming efficiencies. The transposon-derived iPS cells featured typical hallmarks of pluripotency, including teratoma growth in immunodeficient mice. Thus SB and PB transposons represent a promising non-viral approach for iPS cell derivation.',\n",
              "  'Alteration in composition of keratin intermediate filaments in a model of breast cancer progression and the potential to reverse hallmarks of metastasis. BACKGROUND: In breast cancer the development of metastasis is a major turning point in the treatment and outcome of the disease. Throughout tumour development, and especially in the development of metastasis, epithelial mesenchymal transition takes place. During this transformation into a mesenchymal phenotype, the tumour cells undergo a series of structural changes. The loss of structural integrity and adoption of mesenchymal filaments enables cells to detach from the epithelial cell layer and metastasise. Keratins form the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton and provide scaffold structures within cells. During cancer progression the intermediate filaments are reorganised, and dramatic changes are seen in their protein components. Keratins K8, K18, K19 and vimentin are intermediate filament proteins with altered expression profiles during tumour development. METHOD: We have used in vivo and in vitro models to analyse changes in intermediate filament proteins. Antibody-based methods were used to study K8 levels and proteomic analysis to profile the protein content of metastatic breast cancer cell variants. RESULTS: K8 expression declines as human breast tumours progress into an invasive phenotype. Analysis of IF proteins indicated altered expression profiles of K8, K18, K19 and vimentin, with K8, K18, K19 expressed in high levels in the T47D and MCF-7 cell lines, whereas the highly metastatic cell lines expressed lower levels of K8 and K18 and no detectable K19. Vimentin showed reverse expression profile with T47D and MCF-7 cells having no detectable vimentin expression whereas the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 showed high levels. Analysis of acetylation status using specific antibodies suggested acetylation occurred within the central coiled domain in the MCF-7 and T47D cells. Inhibition of tumour growth by tissue factor (TF) shRNA resulted in a dramatic re-elevation of expression of K8 in xenographs of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-436 line. CONCLUSION: Intermediate filament expression alters during epithelial mesenchymal transition. Identified post translational modifications may play a role in alterations seen in the organisation, solubility and stability of these filaments. Epithelial mesenchymal transition can be reversed and an epithelial phenotype re-established.',\n",

OBJECTIVE: To verify the prevalence of morpho-volumetric and functional thyroid abnormalities in young patients with Williams syndrome (WS). STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-two patients with WS (49 boys and 43 girls, 0.2-17.2 years of age) underwent evaluation of thyroid function by means of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), fT3, and fT4 measurement. Thyroid ultrasonography was performed in 37 patients. Thyroid antibodies (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin) were measured in all patients with abnormal thyroid function tests. RESULTS: None of our patients had overt hypothyroidism; 29 patients (31.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid antibodies were absent in all patients. The prevalence of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly higher in the younger patients. Ultrasonography revealed morphological or volumetric abnormalities of the thyroid gland in 67.5% of patients; these abnormalities were more frequently observed in the older children. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism is a frequent but stable finding in young children with WS. The great majority of patients with WS >10 years, either with normal or hypoplastic thyroid, have normal thyroid function. Therefore, we suggest yearly monitoring of thyroid function and sonographic studies at least once in patients with WS. Treatment should be reserved for the patients with overt hypothyroidism or for those whose thyroid function shows signs of progressive deterioration.',\n",

In cell and xenograft models of cancer, we identified treatment-emergent heterozygous mutations in the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket and NEDD8-binding cleft of NAEβ as the primary mechanism of resistance to MLN4924. Biochemical analyses of NAEβ mutants revealed slower rates of adduct formation and reduced adduct affinity for the mutant enzymes. A compound with tighter binding properties was able to potently inhibit mutant enzymes in cells. These data provide rationales for patient selection and the development of next-generation NAE inhibitors designed to overcome treatment-emergent NAEβ mutations.',\n",
              "  'Genitourinary anomalies in Mowat-Wilson syndrome with deletion/mutation in the zinc finger homeo box 1B gene (ZFHX1B). Report of three Italian cases with hypospadias and review. Hypospadias, when the urethra opens on the ventral side of the penis, is a common malformation seen in about 3 per 1,000 male births. It is a complex disorder associated with genetic and environmental factors and can be part of genetic syndromes. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a distinct facial phenotype, Hirschsprung disease, microcephaly and mental retardation. It is caused by mutations in the zinc finger homeo box 1B gene, ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, 68 deletion/mutation-positive cases have been reported. Genitourinary anomalies are common in MWS. Here we report that hypospadias is common in males with this syndrome. In 39 patients where this information was available, hypospadias was present in 46% of patients (18/39). In the 3 Italian male cases reported here, hypospadias was always present. MWS should be considered by endocrinologists in patients with hypospadias associated with developmental delays/mental retardation, in particular in the presence of a distinct facial phenotype.',\n",
              "  'Pendred syndrome and iodide transport in the thyroid. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing impairment, presence of goiter, and a partial defect in iodide organification, which may be associated with insufficient thyroid hormone synthesis. Goiter development and development of hypothyroidism are variable and depend on nutritional iodide intake. Pendred syndrome is caused by biallelic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene, which encodes pendrin, a transporter of chloride, bicarbonate and iodide. This review discusses the controversies surrounding the potential role of pendrin in mediating apical iodide efflux into the lumen of thyroid follicles, and discusses its functional role in the kidney and the inner ear.',\n",
              "  'Musashi1 as a potential therapeutic target and diagnostic marker for lung cancer. Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. One approach to improving survival is the identification of biomarkers to detect early stage disease. In this study, we investigated the potential of the stem cell and progenitor cell marker, Musashi1 (Msi1), as a diagnostic marker and potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. Functional studies in A549 bronchioalveolar carcinoma and NCI-H520 squamous cell carcinoma cells revealed that Msi1 was enriched in spheroid cultures of tumor cells and in the CD133+ cell population. Downregulation of Msi1 by lentivirus-mediated expression of an Msi1 shRNA reduced spheroid colony proliferation. Growth inhibition was associated with reduced nuclear localization of β-catenin and inhibition of the processing of intracellular Notch. In primary lung cancer, Msi1 protein expression was elevated in 86% of 202 tissue microarray specimens, and Msi1 mRNA was increased in 80% of 118 bronchoscopic biopsies, including metastatic disease, but was rarely detected in adjacent normal lung tissue and in non-malignant diseased tissue. Msi1 was expressed in a diffuse pattern in most tumor subtypes, except in squamous cell carcinomas, where it appeared in a focal pattern in 50% of specimens. Thus, Msi1 is a sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for all lung cancer subtypes.',\n",
              "  'The Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale: development and validation of a stroke recognition instrument. BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.',\n",
              "  'A role for p53 in the frequency and mechanism of mutation. The tumor suppressor protein, p53, is often referred to as the guardian of the genome. When p53 function is impaired, its ability to preserve genomic integrity is compromised. This may result in an increase in mutation on both a molecular and chromosomal level and contribute to the progression to a malignant phenotype. In order to study the effect of p53 function on the acquisition of mutation, in vitro and in vivo models have been developed in which both the frequency and mechanism of mutation can be analyzed. In human lymphoblastoid cells in which p53 function was impaired, both the spontaneous and induced mutant frequency increased at the autosomal thymidine kinase (TK) locus. The mutant frequency increased to a greater extent in cell lines in which p53 harbored a point mutation than in those lines in which a \"null\" mutation had been introduced by molecular targeting or by viral degradation indicating a possible \"gain-of-function\" associated with the mutant protein. Further, molecular analysis revealed that the loss of p53 function was associated with a greater tendency towards loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) within the TK gene that was due to non-homologous recombination than that found in wild-type cells. Most data obtained from the in vivo models uses the LacI reporter gene that does not efficiently detect mutation that results in LOH. However, studies that have examined the effect of p53 status on mutation in the adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) gene in transgenic mice also suggest that loss of p53 function results in an increase in mutation resulting from non-homologous recombination. The results of these studies provide clear and convincing evidence that p53 plays a role in modulating the mutant frequency and the mechanism of mutation. In addition, the types of mutation that occur within the p53 gene are also of importance in determining the mutant frequency and the pathways leading to mutation.',\n",
              "  \"Rapid and transient recruitment of DNMT1 to DNA double-strand breaks is mediated by its interaction with multiple components of the DNA damage response machinery. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark critical for regulating transcription, chromatin structure and genome stability. Although many studies have shed light on how methylation impacts transcription and interfaces with the histone code, far less is known about how it regulates genome stability. We and others have shown that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, contributes to the cellular response to DNA damage, yet DNMT1's exact role in this process remains unclear. DNA damage, particularly in the form of double-strand breaks (DSBs), poses a major threat to genome integrity. Cells therefore possess a potent system to respond to and repair DSBs, or to initiate cell death. In the current study, we used a near-infrared laser microirradiation system to directly study the link between DNMT1 and DSBs. Our results demonstrate that DNMT1 is rapidly but transiently recruited to DSBs. DNMT1 recruitment is dependent on its ability to interact with both PCNA and the ATR effector kinase CHK1, but is independent of its catalytic activity. In addition, we show for the first time that DNMT1 interacts with the 9-1-1 PCNA-like sliding clamp and that this interaction also contributes to DNMT1 localization to DNA DSBs. Finally, we demonstrate that DNMT1 modulates the rate of DSB repair and is essential for suppressing abnormal activation of the DNA damage response in the absence of exogenous damage. Taken together, our studies provide compelling additional evidence for DNMT1 acting as a regulator of genome integrity and as an early responder to DNA DSBs.\",\n",
              "  \"Orteronel (TAK-700), a novel non-steroidal 17,20-lyase inhibitor: effects on steroid synthesis in human and monkey adrenal cells and serum steroid levels in cynomolgus monkeys. Surgical or pharmacologic methods to control gonadal androgen biosynthesis are effective approaches in the treatment of a variety of non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseases. For example, androgen ablation and its consequent reduction in circulating levels of testosterone is an effective therapy for advanced prostate cancers. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effectiveness of this approach is often temporary because of disease progression to the 'castration resistant' (CRPC) state, a situation for which there are limited treatment options. One mechanism thought to be responsible for the development of CRPC is extra-gonadal androgen synthesis and the resulting impact of these residual extra-gonadal androgens on prostate tumor cell proliferation. An important enzyme responsible for the synthesis of extra-gonadal androgens is CYP17A1 which possesses both 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase catalytic activities with the 17,20-lyase activity being key in the androgen biosynthetic process. Orteronel (TAK-700), a novel, selective, and potent inhibitor of 17,20-lyase is under development as a drug to inhibit androgen synthesis. In this study, we quantified the inhibitory activity and specificity of orteronel for testicular and adrenal androgen production by evaluating its effects on CYP17A1 enzymatic activity, steroid production in monkey adrenal cells and human adrenal tumor cells, and serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cortisol, and testosterone after oral dosing in castrated and intact male cynomolgus monkeys. We report that orteronel potently suppresses androgen production in monkey adrenal cells but only weakly suppresses corticosterone and aldosterone production; the IC(50) value of orteronel for cortisol was ~3-fold higher than that for DHEA. After single oral dosing, serum levels of DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone were rapidly suppressed in intact cynomolgus monkeys. In castrated monkeys treated twice daily with orteronel, suppression of DHEA and testosterone persisted throughout the treatment period. In both in vivo models and in agreement with our in vitro data, suppression of serum cortisol levels following oral dosing was less than that seen for DHEA. In terms of human CYP17A1 and human adrenal tumor cells, orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity 5.4 times more potently than 17-hydroxylase activity in cell-free enzyme assays and DHEA production 27 times more potently than cortisol production in human adrenal tumor cells, suggesting greater specificity of inhibition between 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities in humans vs monkeys. In summary, orteronel potently inhibited the 17,20-lyase activity of monkey and human CYP17A1 and reduced serum androgen levels in vivo in monkeys. These findings suggest that orteronel may be an effective therapeutic option for diseases where androgen suppression is critical, such as androgen sensitive and CRPC.\",\n",
              "  'Inhibition of RNA lariat debranching enzyme suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in ALS disease models. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective. Here, we report results from two genome-wide loss-of-function TDP-43 toxicity suppressor screens in yeast. The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS.',\n",

              "  'Craniofacial and oral features of Sotos syndrome: differences in patients with submicroscopic deletion and mutation of NSD1 gene. Sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of NSD1 gene located at 5q35. There are two types of mutations that cause NSD1 haploinsufficiency: mutations within the NSD1 gene (mutation type) and a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion encompassing the entire NSD1 gene (deletion type). We investigated detailed craniofacial, dental, and oral findings in five patients with deletion type, and three patients with mutation type Sotos syndrome. All eight patients had a high palate, excessive tooth wear, crowding, and all but one patient had hypodontia and deep bite. Hypodontia was exclusively observed in the second premolars, and there were no differences between the deletion and mutation types in the number of missing teeth. Another feature frequently seen in common with both types was maxillary recession. Findings seen more frequently and more pronounced in deletion-type than in mutation-type included mandibular recession, scissors or posterior cross bite, and small dental arch with labioclination of the maxillary central incisors. It is noteworthy that although either scissors bite or cross bite was present in all of the deletion-type patients, neither of these was observed in mutation-type patients. Other features seen in a few patients include enamel hypoplasia (two deletion patients), and ectopic tooth eruption (one deletion and one mutation patients). Our study suggests that Sotos syndrome patients should be observed closely for possible dental and oral complications especially for malocculusion in the deletion-type patients.',\n",
              "  '[Reported use of thalidomide in multiple myeloma: presentation of problems in the Thaled® outpatient department]. BACKGROUND: Thalidomide was approved in Japan for multiple myeloma treatment in October 2008. A program called the Thalidomide Education and Risk Management System (TERMS®) was established to help ensure that every effort is made to use the drug safely. PURPOSE: We report the use of thalidomide to treat multiple myeloma, and describe problems arising in the Thaled® outpatient department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide at Hitachi General Hospital. INTERVENTION: Monitoring of the efficacy and safety of thalidomide, and a questionnaire survey conducted at the Thaled® outpatient department. RESULTS: The thalidomide response rate was 41. 7%. In 5 cases, all patients received steroids along with thalidomide. After auto-PBSCT, 1 of 2 cases demonstrated a good response (PR 1). After treatment with bortezomib, 1 of 2 cases demonstrated a good response (MR 1). After auto-PBSCT and treatment with bortezomib, 1 of 4 cases demonstrated a good response (PR 1). In a case demonstrating hematotoxicity Grade 3 (in addition to neutropenia), administration was discontinued. Regarding problems in the Thaled® outpatient department, the medical staff indicated that TERMS® is a very complicated program, while the patients requested prolongation of the prescription days and reduction of the economic burden of medication costs. CONCLUSION: Thalidomide showed some success in treating multiple myeloma either after auto-PBSCT or following treatment with bortezomib. In the case demonstrating hematotoxicity Grade 3 (in addition to neutropenia), grave complications could have very easily developed, thus underscoring the importance of careful monitoring. Based on a questionnaire survey conducted in the Thaled® outpatient department, the medical staff made comments and patients raised issues that should be examined in the future.',\n",
              "  'The role of SERCA2a/PLN complex, Ca(2+) homeostasis, and anti-apoptotic proteins in determining cell fate. Intracellular calcium is a major coordinator of numerous aspects of cellular physiology, including muscle contractility and cell survival. In cardiac muscle, aberrant Ca(2+) cycling has been implicated in a range of pathological conditions including cardiomyopathies and heart failure. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) have a central role in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and, therefore, cardiac function. Herein, we discuss the mechanisms through which SERCA2a and PLN control cardiomyocyte function in health and disease. Emphasis is placed on our newly identified PLN-binding partner HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which has an anti-apoptotic function and presents with numerous similarities to Bcl-2. Recent evidence indicates that proteins of the Bcl-2 family can influence ER Ca(2+) content, a critical determinant of cellular sensitivity to apoptosis. The discovery of the PLN/HAX-1 interaction therefore unveils an important new link between Ca(2+) homeostasis and cell survival, with significant therapeutic potential.',\n",
              "  'DUX4 and DUX4 downstream target genes are expressed in fetal FSHD muscles. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent adult muscular dystrophies. The common clinical signs usually appear during the second decade of life but when the first molecular dysregulations occur is still unknown. Our aim was to determine whether molecular dysregulations can be identified during FSHD fetal muscle development. We compared muscle biopsies derived from FSHD1 fetuses and the cells derived from some of these biopsies with biopsies and cells derived from control fetuses. We mainly focus on DUX4 isoform expression because the expression of DUX4 has been confirmed in both FSHD cells and biopsies by several laboratories. We measured DUX4 isoform expression by using qRT-PCR in fetal FSHD1 myotubes treated or not with an shRNA directed against DUX4 mRNA. We also analyzed DUX4 downstream target gene expression in myotubes and fetal or adult FSHD1 and control quadriceps biopsies. We show that both DUX4-FL isoforms are already expressed in FSHD1 myotubes. Interestingly, DUX4-FL expression level is much lower in trapezius than in quadriceps myotubes, which is confirmed by the level of expression of DUX4 downstream genes. We observed that TRIM43 and MBD3L2 are already overexpressed in FSHD1 fetal quadriceps biopsies, at similar levels to those observed in adult FSHD1 quadriceps biopsies. These results indicate that molecular markers of the disease are already expressed during fetal life, thus opening a new field of investigation for mechanisms leading to FSHD.',\n",
              "  'Bach1 functions as a hypoxia-inducible repressor for the heme oxygenase-1 gene in human cells. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) catalyzes heme breakdown, eventually releasing iron, carbon monoxide, and bilirubin IXalpha. HO-1 is induced by its substrate heme and various environmental factors, which represents a protective response against oxidative stresses. Here we show that hypoxia represses HO-1 expression in three human cell types but induces it in rat, bovine, and monkey cells, indicating the inter-species difference in the hypoxic regulation of HO-1 expression. The hypoxia-mediated repression of HO-1 expression is consistently associated with the induction of Bach1, a heme-regulated transcriptional repressor, in human cells. Bach1 is a basic leucine zipper protein, forming a heterodimer with a small Maf protein. Expression of HO-1 was also reduced in human cells when exposed to interferon-gamma or an iron chelator desferrioxamine, each of which induced Bach1 expression. In contrast, induction of HO-1 expression by CoCl(2) is associated with reduced expression of Bach1 mRNA. Thus, expression of HO-1 and Bach1 is inversely regulated. We have identified a Maf recognition element in the human HO-1 gene that is required for repression of a reporter gene by hypoxia and targeted by Bach1. Therefore, Bach1 functions as a hypoxia-inducible repressor for the HO-1 gene, thereby contributing to fine-tuning of oxygen homeostasis in human cells.',\n",

The heat shock protein (HSP) 90 chaperone machine involved in numerous oncogenic signaling pathways is overexpressed in cancer cells and is currently being evaluated for anticancer therapy. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors with increasing incidence and poor prognosis. Here, we report the antiproliferative effects of the HSP90 inhibitors AUY922 and HSP990 in neuroendocrine tumor cells. Treatment of human pancreatic BON1, bronchopulmonary NCI-H727 and midgut carcinoid GOT1 neuroendocrine tumor cells with increasing concentrations of AUY922 and HSP990 dose-dependently suppressed cell viability. Significant effects on neuroendocrine cell viability were observed with inhibitor concentrations as low as 5 nM. Inhibition of cell viability was associated with the induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by an increase in sub-G1 events and PARP cleavage. HSP90 inhibition was associated with decreased neuroendocrine ErbB and IGF-I receptor expression, decreased Erk and Akt phospho-rylation and the induction of HSP70 expression. These findings provide evidence that targeted inhibition of upregulated HSP90 activity could be useful for the treatment of aggressive neuroendocrine tumors resistant to conventional therapy.',\n",

This study investigates the anticancer effect of dehydrocostuslactone (DHE), a medicinal plant-derived sesquiterpene lactone, on human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, A549, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520. Our results show that DHE inhibits the proliferation of A549, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells. DHE-induced apoptosis in both A549 and NCI-H460 cells. DHE triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by changes in cytosol-calcium levels, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) phosphorylation, inositol requiring protein 1 (IRE1) and CHOP/GADD153 upregulation, X-box transcription factor-1 (XBP-1) mRNA splicing, and caspase-4 activation. The release of calcium triggered the production of ROS, which further enhances calcium overloading and subsequently activates p38, JNK and ERK1/2. Both IRE1 miRNA transfection and BAPTA-AM pretreatment inhibit DHE-mediated apoptosis, supporting the hypothesis that DHE induces cell death through ER stress. Importantly, a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and is supported by animal studies which have shown a dramatic 50% reduction in tumor size after 28 days of treatment. This study demonstrates that DHE may be a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.',\n",
              "  'Orteronel plus prednisone in patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ELM-PC 4): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall survival was 31·4 months (95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone. On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

              "  \"H2B ubiquitylation is part of chromatin architecture that marks exon-intron structure in budding yeast. BACKGROUND: The packaging of DNA into chromatin regulates transcription from initiation through 3' end processing. One aspect of transcription in which chromatin plays a poorly understood role is the co-transcriptional splicing of pre-mRNA. RESULTS: Here we provide evidence that H2B monoubiquitylation (H2BK123ub1) marks introns in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A genome-wide map of H2BK123ub1 in this organism reveals that this modification is enriched in coding regions and that its levels peak at the transcribed regions of two characteristic subgroups of genes. First, long genes are more likely to have higher levels of H2BK123ub1, correlating with the postulated role of this modification in preventing cryptic transcription initiation in ORFs. Second, genes that are highly transcribed also have high levels of H2BK123ub1, including the ribosomal protein genes, which comprise the majority of intron-containing genes in yeast. H2BK123ub1 is also a feature of introns in the yeast genome, and the disruption of this modification alters the intragenic distribution of H3 trimethylation on lysine 36 (H3K36me3), which functionally correlates with alternative RNA splicing in humans. In addition, the deletion of genes encoding the U2 snRNP subunits, Lea1 or Msl1, in combination with an htb-K123R mutation, leads to synthetic lethality. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that H2BK123ub1 facilitates cross talk between chromatin and pre-mRNA splicing by modulating the distribution of intronic and exonic histone modifications.\",\n",
              "  'Mepolizumab for prednisone-dependent asthma with sputum eosinophilia. BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic inflammation, which may be a consequence of interleukin-5 action, is a characteristic feature of some forms of asthma. However, in three previous clinical trials involving patients with asthma, blockade of this cytokine did not result in a significant improvement in outcomes. We studied the prednisone-sparing effect of mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, in a rare subgroup of patients who have sputum eosinophilia and airway symptoms despite continued treatment with prednisone. Secondary objectives were to examine its effect on the number of eosinophils in sputum and blood, symptoms, and airflow limitation. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial involving patients with persistent sputum eosinophilia and symptoms despite prednisone treatment, we assigned 9 patients to receive mepolizumab (administered in five monthly infusions of 750 mg each) and 11 patients to receive placebo. RESULTS: There were 12 asthma exacerbations in 10 patients who received placebo, 9 of whom had sputum eosinophilia at the time of exacerbation. In comparison, only one patient who received mepolizumab had an asthma exacerbation, and this episode was not associated with sputum eosinophilia (P=0.002). Patients who received mepolizumab were able to reduce their prednisone dose by a mean (+/-SD) of 83.8+/-33.4% of their maximum possible dose, as compared with 47.7+/-40.5% in the placebo group (P=0.04). The use of mepolizumab was associated with a significant decrease in the number of sputum and blood eosinophils. Improvements in eosinophil numbers, asthma control, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were maintained for 8 weeks after the last infusion. There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Mepolizumab reduced the number of blood and sputum eosinophils and allowed prednisone sparing in patients who had asthma with sputum eosinophilia despite prednisone treatment.

              "  \"Assessment of cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interaction potential of orteronel and exposure changes in patients with renal impairment using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Orteronel is a nonsteroidal, selective inhibitor of 17,20-lyase that was recently in phase 3 clinical development as a treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer. In humans, the primary clearance route for orteronel is renal excretion. Human liver microsomal studies indicated that orteronel weakly inhibits CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, with IC50 values of 17.8, 27.7, 30.8 and 38.8 µm, respectively, whereas orteronel does not inhibit CYP2B6, 2D6 or 3A4/5 (IC50 > 100 µm). Orteronel also does not exhibit time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4/5. The results of a static model indicated an [I]/Ki ratio >0.1 for CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19. Therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between orteronel and theophylline, repaglinide, (S)-warfarin and omeprazole, which are sensitive substrates of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, respectively. Simulation of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of these four CYP substrates in the presence and absence of orteronel revealed geometric mean AUC ratios <1.25. Therefore, in accordance with the 2012 US FDA Draft Guidance on DDIs, orteronel can be labeled a 'non-inhibitor' and further clinical DDI evaluation is not required. In PBPK models of moderate and severe renal impairment, the AUC of orteronel was predicted to increase by 52% and 83%, respectively. These results are in agreement with those of a clinical trial in which AUC increases of 38% and 87% were observed in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.\",\n",
              "  'Current strategies for treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. In spite of significant advances in the management of multiple myeloma (MM), the disease remains incurable and nearly all patients ultimately relapse and require salvage chemotherapy. As such, relapsed and relapsed-refractory MM remains a critical area of research pertaining to biological mechanisms of progression and chemotherapy resistance, as well as to the development of new pharmacologic agents and immunologic approaches for the disease. The immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors represent the cornerstone of treatment in this setting, with combination regimens incorporating these drugs demonstrating encouraging rates and duration of response, including the newer agents, pomalidomide and carfilzomib. In addition, novel drug classes have shown promising activity in RR MM, including the orally-administered proteasome inhibitors ixazomib and oprozomib; monoclonal antibodies such as the anti-CS1 monoclonal antibody elotuzumab and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab; and histone deacetylase inhibitors such as panobinostat and rocilinostat.',\n",
              "  \"Self-reported ill health in male UK Gulf War veterans: a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: Forces deployed to the first Gulf War report more ill health than veterans who did not serve there. Many studies of post-Gulf morbidity are based on relatively small sample sizes and selection bias is often a concern. In a setting where selection bias relating to the ill health of veterans may be reduced, we: i) examined self-reported adult ill health in a large sample of male UK Gulf War veterans and a demographically similar non-deployed comparison group; and ii) explored self-reported ill health among veterans who believed that they had Gulf War syndrome. METHODS: This study uses data from a retrospective cohort study of reproduction and child health in which a validated postal questionnaire was sent to all UK Gulf War veterans (GWV) and a comparison cohort of Armed Service personnel who were not deployed to the Gulf (NGWV). The cohort for analysis comprises 42,818 males who responded to the questionnaire. RESULTS: We confirmed that GWV report higher rates of general ill health. GWV were significantly more likely to have reported at least one new medical symptom or disease since 1990 than NGWV (61% versus 37%, OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5-2.8). They were also more likely to report higher numbers of symptoms. The strongest associations were for mood swings (OR 20.9, 95%CI 16.2-27.0), memory loss/lack of concentration (OR 19.6, 95% CI 15.5-24.8), night sweats (OR 9.9, 95% CI 6.5-15.2), general fatigue (OR 9.6, 95% CI 8.3-11.1) and sexual dysfunction (OR 4.6, 95%CI 3.2-6.6). 6% of GWV believed they had Gulf War syndrome (GWS), and this was associated with the highest symptom reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of reported ill health among GWV were confirmed. This study was the first to use a questionnaire which did not focus specifically on the veterans' symptoms themselves. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with those of other studies of post-Gulf war illness and thus strengthen overall findings in this area of research. Further examination of the mechanisms underlying the reporting of ill health is required.\",\n",
              "  'Suitability of [18F]altanserin and PET to determine 5-HT2A receptor availability in the rat brain: in vivo and in vitro validation of invasive and non-invasive kinetic models. PURPOSE: While the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin is well established in humans, the present study evaluated its suitability for quantifying cerebral 5-HT2ARs with positron emission tomography (PET) in albino rats. PROCEDURES: Ten Sprague Dawley rats underwent 180 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on the basis of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo 5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated by in vitro autoradiographic saturation experiments in the same animals. RESULT: Overall brain uptake of [18F]altanserin was reliably quantified by invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as reference region shown by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no lipophilic metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound. PET data correlated very well with in vitro autoradiographic data of the same animals. CONCLUSION: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of 5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Models based on both blood input and reference tissue describe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer uptake might, however, cause restrictions in experimental usage.',\n",
              "  \"Molecular cloning and expression of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) vestitone reductase, the penultimate enzyme in medicarpin biosynthesis. Medicarpin, the major phytoalexin in alfalfa, is synthesized by way of the isoflavonoid branch of phenylpropanoid metabolism. One of the final steps of medicarpin biosynthesis, from vestitone to 7,2'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanol, is catalyzed by vestitone reductase. A 1245-bp cDNA clone which encodes vestitone reductase was identified utilizing internal amino acid sequence of purified vestitone reductase. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the cloned enzyme exhibits strict substrate stereospecificity for (3R)-vestitone, as was observed for vestitone reductase purified from alfalfa. The calculated molecular weight of the protein (35,918) is similar to that of purified vestitone reductase from alfalfa (38 kDa by SDS-PAGE). The levels of vestitone reductase transcript (1.35 kb) greatly increase within 2 h of elicitor addition to alfalfa cell suspension cultures, preceding the rapid increases in vestitione reductase enzyme activity and medicarpin biosynthesis. In healthy alfalfa plants, the highest levels of transcripts were detected in roots and root nodules, consistent with the synthesis of medicarpin and its conjugate in these tissues. The cloning of the vestitone reductase gene provides a specific tool for the study and manipulation of pterocarpan biosynthesis in legumes.\",\n",
              "  \"Donohue syndrome in a neonate with homozygous deletion of exon 3 of the insulin receptor gene. Donohue syndrome describes the clinical consequences of the most severe genetic loss of insulin receptor function. The cardinal features are severe linear growth impairment pre- and postnatally with abnormal glucose metabolism and a characteristic pattern of soft tissue overgrowth. We report a 5 day old neonate with refractory hyperglycemia and paradoxical hypoglycemia, severe intrauterine growth retardation, typical 'elfin' facies (hypertrichosis, large and low-set ears, broad nasal tip, flared nares, thick lips), reduced subcutaneous fat, distended abdomen, and enlarged external genitalia and nipples. Fasting serum insulin and C-peptide were severely elevated at >2,100 pmol/l and >2,331 pmol/l, respectively. In addition, hepatic, ovarian and renal enlargement was demonstrated by ultrasonography. The neonate died within two months secondary to hypoglycemia. Diplex PCR analysis of the insulin receptor gene revealed the neonate to be homozygous for deletion of exon 3. Both parents were heterozygous for this deletion but were metabolically healthy. As such a deletion has previously been reported in Israel, we suggest that it may show a founder effect in the Middle East.\",\n",
              "  'Three periods of regulatory innovation during vertebrate evolution. The gain, loss, and modification of gene regulatory elements may underlie a substantial proportion of phenotypic changes on animal lineages. To investigate the gain of regulatory elements throughout vertebrate evolution, we identified genome-wide sets of putative regulatory regions for five vertebrates, including humans. These putative regulatory regions are conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which are evolutionarily conserved yet do not overlap any coding or noncoding mature transcript. We then inferred the branch on which each CNEE came under selective constraint. Our analysis identified three extended periods in the evolution of gene regulatory elements. Early vertebrate evolution was characterized by regulatory gains near transcription factors and developmental genes, but this trend was replaced by innovations near extracellular signaling genes, and then innovations near posttranslational protein modifiers.',\n",
              "  \"Anti-IL-5 recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. BACKGROUND: Eosinophils may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD). Interleukin-5 is essential for eosinophil growth, differentiation and migration. A monoclonal antibody to human interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) was developed for atopic diseases. This study was designed to study the effect of mepolizumab in AD. METHODS: Two single doses of 750 mg mepolizumab, given 1 week apart, were studied in patients with moderate to severe AD using a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group design. The primary endpoint of 'success' to treatment was defined as the percentage of patients with at least 'marked improvement' after 2 weeks as assessed by the Physician's Global Assessment of Improvement (PGA). Furthermore, SCORing AD (SCORAD), pruritus scoring, number of blood eosinophils and serum thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) values served as secondary endpoints. Fluticasone propionate cream 0.05%, once daily could be used as rescue medication from day 16 if no improvement was recorded. RESULTS: Eighteen patients received mepolizumab and 22 placebo treatment. Peripheral blood eosinophil numbers were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with placebo (P < 0.05). No clinical success was reached by PGA assessment (P = 0.115), SCORAD (P = 0.293), pruritus scoring and TARC values in the mepolizumab-treated group compared with placebo. However, modest improvement (<50% improvement) assessed by PGA was scored significantly more in the mepolizumab-treated group compared with placebo (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Two single doses of 750 mg mepolizumab did not result in clinical success in patients with AD, despite a significant decrease in peripheral blood eosinophils.\",\n",
              "  'Nonsense mutations of the ZFHX1B gene in two Japanese girls with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly-mental retardation complex caused by mutations in the Zinc Finger Homeobox 1 B gene (ZFHX1B). MWS has been reported in association with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). MWS is sometimes difficult to diagnose clinically, especially when HSCR is absent. Thus, it is necessary to detect gene abnormalities at the molecular level. Here we report two Japanese girls with MWS, who showed a distinct facial phenotype, severe intellectual disability and epileptic seizures. Major congenital anomalies of the patients were very different. Patient 1 suffered from severe congenital heart disease, but did not show apparent HSCR. Patient 2 suffered from typical HSCR and underwent surgical treatment, but did not have congenital heart disease. According to the gene analysis using white blood cells, they had nonsense mutations in ZFHX1B, R695X and Q433X, respectively. In conclusion, molecular genetic analysis of ZFHX1B is important for a definite diagnosis of MWS which has a wide phenotypic spectrum of congenital anomalies.',\n",
              "  'Comprehensive ZEB2 gene analysis for Mowat-Wilson syndrome in a North American cohort: a suggested approach to molecular diagnostics. Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a recognizable facial phenotype in addition to moderate to severe cognitive disability with severe speech impairment and variable multiple congenital anomalies. The anomalies may include Hirschsprung disease, heart defects, structural eye anomalies including microphthalmia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and urogenital anomalies. Microcephaly, seizure disorder and constipation are common. All typical cases result from haploinsufficiency of the ZEB2 (also known as ZFHX1B or SIP-1) gene, with over 100 distinct mutations now described. Approximately 80% of patients have a nonsense or frameshift mutation detectable by sequencing, with the rest having gross deletions necessitating a dosage sensitive assay. Here we report on the results of comprehensive molecular testing for 27 patients testing positive for MWS. Twenty-one patients had a nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutation identified by sequencing; 14 of which localized to exon 8 and 17 of which are novel. Six patients had deletions in the ZEB2 gene, including two novel partial gene deletions. This report, the first such analysis in North American patients, adds to the growing list of both novel pathogenic mutations associated with MWS, as well as other variants in the ZEB2 gene. In addition, we suggest an economical testing strategy.',\n",
              "  'Microsporidia infection of the cornea--a unique and challenging disease. Microsporidia are a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, eukaryotic, spore-forming parasites. Traditionally, these were considered as protozoans but recently have been reclassified as fungi. Microsporidia behave as opportunistic pathogens causing systemic infections. In the eye, Microsporidia cause keratoconjunctivitis, corneal stromal keratitis, scleritis, and endophthalmitis. This review shares our experiences with anterior segment infections caused by this pathogen. Keratoconjunctivitis is a common form of ocular infection caused by the parasite. Although early reports described it as occurring only in immunosuppressed individuals, it can also occur in immunocompetent individuals. The disease shows a seasonal pattern with a peak incidence during the rainy season. Although several drugs have been considered, our experience suggests that keratoconjunctivitis is a self-limiting disease. In contrast to keratoconjunctivitis, stromal keratitis is an ill-defined disease. We collected 30 cases and analyzed the various aspects of this disease. Stromal keratitis is characterized by a slowly progressive course. The corneal picture resembles herpes simplex virus stromal keratitis or fungal keratitis cases, and is characterized by deep stromal infiltrates with overlying and surrounding stromal edema and keratic precipitates. The diagnosis of Microsporidia infection is confirmed by a microscopic examination of smears from patients with ulcerative keratitis or by a histopathological examination of corneal tissues. Definitive genus identification requires the examination of specimens by electron microscopy or by molecular methods. In the absence of a definitive medical treatment, nearly all patients require surgical treatment. The confusion regarding Microsporidia is not only limited to their classification but also extends to various aspects of the corneal disease caused by them.',\n",
              "  'Chromosome XII context is important for rDNA function in yeast. The rDNA cluster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is located 450 kb from the left end and 610 kb from the right end of chromosome XII and consists of approximately 150 tandemly repeated copies of a 9.1 kb rDNA unit. To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number. The frequency of silencing of URA3 inserted within the rDNA locus was found to be greater than in a wild-type strain. The localization and morphology of the nucleolus was also affected such that a single and occasionally (6-12% frequency) two foci for Nop1p and a rounded nucleolus were observed, whereas a typical crescent-shaped nucleolar structure was seen in the wild-type strain. Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spans than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles. These observations suggest that the context of chromosome XII plays an important role in maintaining a constant rDNA copy number and in physiological processes related to rDNA function in S.cerevisiae.',\n",
              "  'Early non-invasive detection of fetal Y chromosome sequences in maternal plasma using multiplex PCR. OBJECTIVE: Clinical indications for fetal sex determination include risk of X-linked disorders, a family history of conditions associated with ambiguous development of the external genitalia, and some fetal ultrasound findings. It is usually performed in the first trimester from fetal material obtained through CVS and is associated with an approximately 1% risk of miscarriage. Ultrasound fetal sex determination is often performed after 11 weeks of gestation. This study aims to validate a reliable method for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal gender using maternal plasma cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) for fetal sex assessment in the first trimester of pregnancy and test its clinical utility in the diagnosis of potentially affected pregnancies in carriers of X-linked disorders. STUDY DESIGN: In the validation study, blood samples from 100 pregnant women at 6-11 weeks of gestation were analysed. In the clinical study, 17 pregnancies at risk of having an affected fetus were tested. 7 ml of maternal blood in EDTA were obtained and cffDNA was extracted using a commercially available kit. DNA was enzymatically digested using a methylation sensitive endonuclease (AciI) to remove maternal unmethylated sequences of the RASSF1A gene. A multiplex PCR was performed for the simultaneous amplification of target sequences of SRY and DYS14 from chromosome Y, along with RASSF1A and ACTB sequences. Amplification of these loci indicates fetal gender, confirms the presence of cffDNA and allows assessment of digestion efficiency. RESULTS: After establishing the appropriate experimental conditions, validation studies were successful in all 100 cases tested with no false negative or false positive results. Y chromosome-specific sequences were detected in 68 samples, and 32 cases were diagnosed as female based on the amplification of RASFF1A sequences only, in the absence of ACTB. In the clinical studies, fetal sex was correctly diagnosed in 16 pregnancies, and one case was reported as inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal sex assessment by detecting Y chromosome sequences in maternal blood can be routinely used from the 6th week of gestation. Reliable fetal sex determination from maternal blood in the 1st trimester of gestation can avoid conventional invasive methods of prenatal diagnosis.',\n",
              "  'Woman with x-linked recessive dystonia-parkinsonism: clue to the epidemiology of parkinsonism in Filipino women? IMPORTANCE: Despite recessive inheritance, X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (Lubag disease) has also been described in women presenting with a late-onset isolated parkinsonian syndrome. Interestingly, unlike in other populations, there is a slight female predominance in the prevalence of parkinsonism in the Philippines. OBSERVATIONS: In a Filipino woman with suspected Parkinson disease, we confirmed the presence of all changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism in genomic DNA. Subsequently, we analyzed complementary DNA and evaluated the methylation status of the androgen receptor gene. Owing to extremely skewed (98%:2%) X-chromosome inactivation, the patient expressed almost solely the mutated allele in a disease-specific change, rendering her molecularly comparable with a hemizygously affected man. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Skewed X-chromosome inactivation is the likely cause of parkinsonism in this heterozygous mutation carrier. Because women carriers of the genetic changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism are common in the Philippines, the epigenetic factor of nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation may contribute to the skewing of the sex prevalence of parkinsonism toward women in this country, warranting further investigation.',\n",

In order to investigate the biological function of the human CLN3 gene that is defective in Batten disease, we created a yeast strain by PCR-targeted disruption of the yeast gene (YHC3), which is a homologue of the human CLN3 gene. 2. The phenotypic characterization revealed that the yhc3 delta mutants are more sensitive to combined heat and alkaline stress than the wild-type strains as determined by inhibition of cell proliferation. 3. This suggests that the yhc3 delta mutant is a good model to investigate the biological function of human CLN3 gene in mammalian cells and to understand the pathophysiology of juvenile Batten disease.',\n",
              "  'A histone H3 methyltransferase controls epigenetic events required for meiotic prophase. Epigenetic modifications of histones regulate gene expression and chromatin structure. Here we show that Meisetz (meiosis-induced factor containing a PR/SET domain and zinc-finger motif) is a histone methyltransferase that is important for the progression of early meiotic prophase. Meisetz transcripts are detected only in germ cells entering meiotic prophase in female fetal gonads and in postnatal testis. Notably, Meisetz has catalytic activity for trimethylation, but not mono- or dimethylation, of lysine 4 of histone H3, and a transactivation activity that depends on its methylation activity. Mice in which the Meisetz gene is disrupted show sterility in both sexes due to severe impairment of the double-stranded break repair pathway, deficient pairing of homologous chromosomes and impaired sex body formation. In Meisetz-deficient testis, trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 is attenuated and meiotic gene transcription is altered. These findings indicate that meiosis-specific epigenetic events in mammals are crucial for proper meiotic progression.',\n",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the triad of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia and a neutrophilic dermatosis that is caused by mutations in LPIN2. Long-term outcome is poor. This is the first report detailing the treatment of Majeed syndrome with biological agents and demonstrates clinical improvement with IL-1blockade. METHODS: We describe the clinical presentation, genetic analysis, cytokine profiles and response to biological therapy in two brothers with Majeed syndrome. RESULTS: Both boys were homozygous for a novel 2-base pair deletion in LPIN2 (c.1312_1313delCT; p.Leu438fs+16X), confirming the diagnosis. Their bone disease and anaemia were refractory to treatment with corticosteroids. Both siblings had elevated proinflammatory cytokines in their serum, including tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), however a trial of the TNF inhibitor etanercept resulted in no improvement. IL-1 inhibition with either a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) or an anti-IL-1β antibody (canakinumab) resulted in dramatic clinical and laboratory improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The differential response to treatment with TNF-α or IL-1 blocking agents sheds light into disease pathogenesis; it supports the hypothesis that Majeed syndrome is an IL-1β dependent autoinflammatory disorder, and further underscores the importance of IL-1 in sterile bone inflammation.',\n",

              "  '[Phenotypic evaluation of patients with Pendred syndrome]. INTRODUCTION: The Pendred syndrome (PS) is an autosomally recessively inherited disease. Its diagnosis requires identification of the classical triad of symptoms, including hypoacusis, thyroid goitre and iodine organification defect in the thyroid, which may lead to thyroid functional disorders of hypothyroidism. SP is accompanied by anatomical anomalies. The objective is the hearing and balance system evaluation and the analysis of the inner ear structure and also the assessment of the function and structure of thyroid gland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the research four families were qualified, 7 persons with PS, 12 persons altogether. In all the patients the anamnesis in the form of a questionnaire and laryngological examination were performed. It was followed by pure tone, speech and impedance audiometry and brainstem response testing as well. ENG was also conducted. Patients with hearing loss were subjected to magnetic resonance of temporal bone. For the whole group thyroid hormones levels and iodine organification in the thyroid identified in a test with potassium perchlorate were measured and also USG and scyntography were conducted. RESULTS: In audiological examination in 3 cases deafness, in 2 cases profound hypoacusis and in 2 mild hypoacusis were recognised. In the group in 2 patients the hypoacusis was of a mixed type. In radiological assessment the labirynth showed anatomical anomalies in the form of enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct and the endolyphatic sac, yet in 3 patients the anomalies also concerned the structure of cochlear and semicircular canals. Endocrine examination showed hypothyroidism in 5, its subclinical form in 1, diffuse thyroid goitre in 4 and nodular thyroid goiter in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: A complex clinical evaluation: endocrine and audiological, together with radiological diagnostic imaging, supported by molecular studies of SLC26A4 gene, are the procedures, necessary for complete and accurate diagnosis of PS and EVAS.',\n",

BACKGROUND: Serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels correlate with disease outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. Siltuximab, a chimeric, murine-human mAb against IL-6, was evaluated in a three-part phase I/II study in patients with progressive metastatic RCC. METHODS: In part 1, 11 patients received 1, 3, 6, or 12mgkg-¹ at weeks 1, 4 and q2w × 2 thereafter; in part 2, 37 patients randomly received 3 or 6 mgkg-¹ q3w × 4; in part 3, 20 low-risk patients received 6mgkg-¹ q2w × 6. Modified WHO response criteria were assessed at weeks 7, 11, the 6-week follow-up, and when clinically indicated. RESULTS: Siltuximab was well tolerated overall, with no maximum tolerated dose or immune response observed. In all, 5 out of 11, 17 out of 37, and 9 out of 20 patients in parts 1, 2, and 3, respectively, received extended treatment beyond 4-6 initial infusions. In part 2, stable disease (SD) ( > 11weeks) or better was achieved by 11 out of 17 (65%) 3 mgkg-¹ treated patients (one partial response (PR) ~8 months, 10 SD) and 10 out of 20 (50%) 6mgkg-¹ treated patients (10 SD). In part 3, documented complete or PR was not observed, but 13 out of 20 (65%) patients achieved SD. CONCLUSION: Siltuximab stabilised disease in >50% of progressive metastatic RCC patients. One PR was observed. Given the favourable safety profile of siltuximab and poor correlation of tumour shrinkage with clinical benefit demonstrated for other non-cytotoxic therapies, further evaluation of dose-escalation strategies and/or combination therapy may be considered for patients with RCC.',\n",

The rhabdoid phenotype represents an aggressive biological behavior, but the rhabdoid feature has hitherto not been reported in cases of SNTCS. A 46-year-old man complained of a 1-month history of left-sided nasal obstruction. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor mass involving the left nasal cavity, ethmoid sinus, and ethmoid bone with extension to the left frontal lobe of the brain. A gross total resection of the mass was performed and postoperative radiation therapy administered. Seven weeks later, several recurring masses were detected in the left frontotemporal lobe of the brain. A gross total resection of the mass was performed and postoperative chemotherapy administered. Histopathologically, the tumor showed benign and malignant epithelial, mesenchymal, neural, and immature elements. In addition, diffuse sheets of rhabdoid cells were immunopositive for vimentin, nestin, neuron-specific enolase, and INI1. Ultrastructurally, rhabdoid cells showed paranuclear aggregates and whorls of intermediate filaments with a 9-10 nm diameter. In conclusion, we report first case of rhabdoid features in SNTCS. The present case showed an advanced stage and early recurrence; the rhabdoid component was probably responsible for this aggressive behavior.',\n",
              "  'deltaNp73 facilitates cell immortalization and cooperates with oncogenic Ras in cellular transformation in vivo. TP73, despite significant homology to TP53, is not a classic tumor suppressor gene, since it exhibits upregulation of nonmutated products in human tumors and lacks a tumor phenotype in p73-deficient mice. We recently reported that an N-terminally truncated isoform, DeltaNp73, is upregulated in breast and gynecological cancers. We further showed that DeltaNp73 is a potent transdominant inhibitor of wild-type p53 and TAp73 in cultured human tumor cells by efficiently counteracting their target gene transactivations, apoptosis, and growth suppression functions (A. I. Zaika et al., J. Exp. Med. 6:765-780, 2002). Although these data strongly suggest oncogenic properties of DeltaNp73, this can only be directly shown in primary cells. We report here that DeltaNp73 confers resistance to spontaneous replicative senescence of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and immortalizes MEFs at a 1,000-fold-higher frequency than occurs spontaneously. DeltaNp73 cooperates with cMyc and E1A in promoting primary cell proliferation and colony formation and compromises p53-dependent MEF apoptosis. Importantly, DeltaNp73 rescues Ras-induced senescence. Moreover, DeltaNp73 cooperates with oncogenic Ras in transforming primary fibroblasts in vitro and in inducing MEF-derived fibrosarcomas in vivo in nude mice. Wild-type p53 is likely a major target of DeltaNp73 inhibition in primary fibroblasts since deletion of p53 or its requisite upstream activator ARF abrogates the growth-promoting effect of DeltaNp73. Taken together, DeltaNp73 behaves as an oncogene that targets p53 that might explain why DeltaNp73 upregulation may be selected for during tumorigenesis of human cancers.',\n",

DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) has a higher specific activity on hemimethylated DNA than on unmethylated DNA, but this preference is too small to explain the faithful mitotic inheritance of genomic methylation patterns. New genetic studies in plants and mammals have identified a novel factor that increases the fidelity of maintenance methylation.',\n",
              "  'Test-retest variability of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor binding measured with positron emission tomography and [18F]altanserin in the human brain. The role of serotonin in CNS function and in many neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, affective disorders, degenerative dementias) support the development of a reliable measure of serotonin receptor binding in vivo in human subjects. To this end, the regional distribution and intrasubject test-retest variability of the binding of [18F]altanserin were measured as important steps in the further development of [18F]altanserin as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Two high specific activity [18F]altanserin PET studies were performed in normal control subjects (n = 8) on two separate days (2-16 days apart). Regional specific binding was assessed by distribution volume (DV), estimates that were derived using a conventional four compartment (4C) model, and the Logan graphical analysis method. For both analysis methods, levels of [18F]altanserin binding were highest in cortical areas, lower in the striatum and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 13% or less were observed for the 4C model DV determined in regions with high receptor concentrations with greater variability in regions with low concentrations (16-20%). For all regions, the absolute value of the test-retest differences in the Logan DV values averaged 12% or less. The test-retest differences in the DV ratios (regional DV values normalized to the cerebellar DV) determined by both data analysis methods averaged less than 10%. The regional [18F]altanserin DV values using both of these methods were significantly correlated with literature-based values of the regional concentrations of 5-HT2A receptors determined by postmortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the 4C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for the Logan method). Brain uptake studies in rats demonstrated that two different radiolabeled metabolites of [18F]altanserin (present at levels of 3-25% of the total radioactivity in human plasma 10-120 min postinjection) were able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, neither of these radiolabeled metabolites bound specifically to the 5-HT2A receptor and did not interfere with the interpretation of regional [18F]altanserin-specific binding parameters obtained using either a conventional 4C model or the Logan graphical analysis method. In summary, these results demonstrate that the test-retest variability of [18F]altanserin-specific binding is comparable to that of other PET radiotracers and that the regional specific binding of [18F]altanserin in human brain was correlated with the known regional distribution of 5-HT2A receptors. These findings support the usefulness of [18F]altanserin as a radioligand for PET studies of 5-HT2A receptors.',\n",
              "  'Ficolins and the lectin pathway of complement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The complement system plays a pathophysiological role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study aims to investigate whether an association exists between the ficolins that are part of the lectin complement pathway and SLE. EDTA plasma samples from 68 Danish SLE patients and 29 healthy donors were included in the study. Plasma concentrations of Ficolin-1, -2, and -3 were determined in specific sandwich ELISAs. Lectin pathway activity via Ficolin-3 was measured in ELISA on acetylated bovine serum albumin (acBSA) and measured as Ficolin-3 binding and deposition of C4, C3 and the terminal complement complex (TCC). SLE patients had increased levels of Ficolin-3, 21.6μg/ml as compared to 17.0μg/ml in healthy controls (P=0.0098). The Ficolin-1 plasma concentration was negatively correlated with SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) (Rho=-0.29, P=0.015) and positively correlated to the [Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index] (SDI) (Rho=0.27, P=0.026). The Ficolin-1 concentration was also associated with the occurrence of arterial (P=0.0053) but not venous thrombosis (P=0.42). Finally, deposition of C4, C3 and TCC in the Ficolin-3 pathway were all correlated to SLEDAI, respectively (P<0.0076). The Ficolin-1 association to SLEDAI and SDI as well as arterial thrombosis shown in this study suggests that Ficolin-1 may be a potential new biomarker for patients with SLE. Furthermore, Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation may be valuable in monitoring disease activity in SLE patients due to the high sensitivity for complement consumption in the assay independent of the Ficolin-3 concentration.',\n",
              "  \"Negative regulation of the tumor suppressor p53 gene by microRNAs. The tumor suppressor p53, encoded by the TP53 gene, is recognized as the guardian of the human genome because it regulates many downstream genes to exercise its function in cell cycle and cell death. Recent studies have revealed that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are important components of the p53 tumor suppressor network with miR-125b and miR-504 directly targeting TP53. In this study, we use a screening method to identify that two miRNAs (miR-25 and miR-30d) directly target the 3'UTR of TP53 to downregulate p53 protein levels and reduce the expression of genes that are transcriptionally activated by p53. Correspondingly, both miR-25 and miR-30d adversely affect apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Inhibition of either miR-25 or miR-30d expression increases endogenous p53 expression and elevates cellular apoptosis in several cell lines, including one from multiple myeloma that has little TP53 mutations. Thus, beyond miR-125b and miR-504, the human TP53 gene is negatively regulated by two more miRNAs: miR-25 and miR-30d.\",\n",
              "  'Ficolin-3-mediated lectin complement pathway activation in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. OBJECTIVES: To assess the involvement of ficolin-3, the main initiator of the lectin complement pathway (LCP), in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) pathology and outcome. METHODS: In this preliminary exploratory study, plasma concentration of ficolin-3 and of ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was measured, along with that of other LCP initiators (mannose-binding lectin, ficolin-2, and ficolin-1), C3 activation products, and soluble C5b-9 terminal complex, in a prospective cohort of 39 patients with SAH and 20 healthy controls. The following parameters were recorded: SAH severity, assessed using the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale; vasospasm, defined as neuro-worsening with angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing; cerebral ischemia, defined as hypodense lesion on CT scan performed before discharge; and 6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. RESULTS: In patients, no changes were detected for ficolin-3 compared with controls. Notably, however, ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity was reduced. Low levels of plasma ficolin-3 and ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity were related to SAH severity, vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia. Moreover, ficolin-3 functional LCP activity was decreased in patients with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that LCP is activated after SAH and that the actual plasma concentrations of ficolin-3 reflect the severity of brain injury as evaluated by clinical and structural parameters. These results support the idea that ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity may be targeted to control injury progression in SAH.',\n",
              "  '[Factors associated with achievement and durability of cytogenetic response in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib]. BACKGROUND/AIM: Imatinib mesylate, a selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has revolutionized the treatment of Bcr-Abl positive chronic myeloid leukemia and become the standard of care for this disease. The aim of this study was evaluation and analysis of cytogenetic response in different intervals and risk groups as well as finding association between pre-treatment characteristics and later probability of achievement of major cytogenetic response. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 22 adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia positive early chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia treated at our institution from June 2006 to December 2009. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for patients during treatment with imatinib was 25.7 months (range, 12-42 months). A complete hematologic response was achieved in all of the analyzed patients within 6 months from the start of the treatment. The major cytogenetic response rate was 81.8%, and the complete cytogenetic response rate was 72.7%. The patients with low or moderate relative risk had the rate of complementary achieving major and complete cytogenetic response of 75-90%. A multivariate analysis identified the following independent prognostic factors for achieving major cytogenetic response: the absence of splenomegaly, white blood cell count less than 10 x 10(9)/L, the platelet count less than 450 x 10(9)/L, the presence of less than 5% of bone marrow blasts and basophils, the absence of blasts in peripheral blood, the presence of less than 7% of basophils in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: Patients who early achieve complete and major cytogenetic response as well as those with low and moderate relative risk have a higher rate of achieving and maintaining complete cytogenetic response. There are also characteristics of patients before treatment that may indicate the treatment outcome.',\n",
              "  'Netherton syndrome and its multifaceted defective protein LEKTI. Netherton syndrome (NS, OMIM 256500) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder manifesting with congenital ichthyosis, a specific hair shaft abnormality named trichorrhexis invaginata, and atopic manifestations. Because of severe complications frequently occurring in the neonatal period, NS prognosis can be poor in infancy. NS is due to loss-of-function mutations in the SPINK5 gene and to the consequent lack of expression of its encoded protein LEKTI in the skin and all stratified epithelial tissues. Following the identification of the NS causative gene and protein, specific diagnostic tools have been developed, thus breaking up the challenge of distinguishing NS from other congenital ichthyoses with overlapping features, and from severe, early-onset forms of atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Intensive efforts to extend the knowledge into the pathomechanisms of NS have also been made. However, NS management is still problematic due to the lack of specific treatment and unmet needs. This overview summarizes the current state of the art in NS research with an emphasis on the progress made toward disease-specific innovative therapy development.',\n",

INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of empagliflozin in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 4-week, multiple dose, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients (n\\xa0=\\xa0100) were randomized to receive 1, 5, 10 or 25\\xa0mg of empagliflozin, or placebo once daily. Key end-points were urinary glucose excretion (UGE), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and eight-point glucose profile. RESULTS: Data are presented for 1, 5, 10, 25\\xa0mg of empagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day\\xa027 in UGE were 40.8, 77.1, 80.9, 93.0 and -2.1\\xa0g (P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001 for all empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day 28 in FPG were -1.56, -1.96, -2.31, -2.37 and -0.86\\xa0mmol/L (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01 for all empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day\\xa027 in eight-point glucose profile were -1.96, -2.21, -2.42, -2.54 and -0.97\\xa0mmol/L (P\\xa0<\\xa00.01 for all empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Empagliflozin reached peak plasma concentration 1.5-2\\xa0h after dosing. Mean steady state terminal elimination half-lives ranged from 13.2 to 18.0\\xa0h. Of 100 patients, 25 experienced an adverse event, occurring more frequently for empagliflozin (29.1%) than placebo (9.5%); frequency was not dose related.

              "  'The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat alone, and in combination with trastuzumab, decreases the cancer stem cell population and self-renewal of HER2+ breast cancer cells. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumor progression, metastasis, and recurrence. HER2 overexpression is associated with increased CSCs, which may explain the aggressive phenotype and increased likelihood of recurrence for HER2(+) breast cancers. Telomerase is reactivated in tumor cells, including CSCs, but has limited activity in normal tissues, providing potential for telomerase inhibition in anti-cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC and non-CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines. The effects of imetelstat on CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cells were measured by ALDH activity and CD44/24 expression by flow cytometry as well as mammosphere assays for functionality. Combination studies in vitro and in vivo were utilized to test for synergism between imetelstat and trastuzumab. Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations. Moreover, imetelstat alone and in combination with trastuzumab reduced the CSC fraction and inhibited CSC functional ability, as shown by decreased mammosphere counts and invasive potential. Tumor growth rate was slower in combination-treated mice compared to either drug alone. Additionally, there was a trend toward decreased CSC marker expression in imetelstat-treated xenograft cells compared to vehicle control. Furthermore, the observed decrease in CSC marker expression occurred prior to and after telomere shortening, suggesting that imetelstat acts on the CSC subpopulation in telomere length-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our study suggests addition of imetelstat to trastuzumab may enhance the effects of HER2 inhibition therapy, especially in the CSC population.',\n",
              "  'The p73 tumor suppressor is targeted by Pirh2 RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase for the proteasome-dependent degradation. The p73 gene, a homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. TAp73 has similar activity as p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor whereas ΔNp73 has both pro- and anti-survival functions. While p73 is rarely mutated in spontaneous tumors, the expression status of p73 is linked to the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy and prognosis for many types of human cancer. Thus, uncovering its regulators in tumors is of great interest. Here, we found that Pirh2, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of p73. Specifically, we showed that knockdown of Pirh2 up-regulates, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 down-regulates, expression of endogenous and exogenous p73. In addition, Pirh2 physically associates with and promotes TAp73 polyubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we found that p73 can be degraded by both 20 S and 26 S proteasomes. Finally, we showed that Pirh2 knockdown leads to growth suppression in a TAp73-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings indicate that Pirh2 promotes the proteasomal turnover of TAp73, and thus targeting Pirh2 to restore TAp73-mediated growth suppression in p53-deficient tumors may be developed as a novel anti-cancer strategy.',\n",
              "  'New drugs in migraine treatment and prophylaxis: telcagepant and topiramate. Although the triptan drugs provide effective relief from migraine for many patients, a substantial number of affected individuals are unresponsive to these compounds, and such therapy can also lead to a range of adverse effects. Telcagepant represents a new class of antimigraine drug-the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers. This compound exerts its effects by blocking receptors for the calcitonin-gene-related peptide at several sites in the trigeminal and central nervous systems, resulting in pain relief. Telcagepant does not cause vasoconstriction, a major limitation in the use of triptans. Comparisons with triptans in clinical trials for acute treatment of migraine attacks revealed clinical effects similar to those of triptans but better than those of placebo. Telcagepant might provide hope for those who have a poor response to, or are unable to use, older drugs. In patients who need prophylaxis because of frequent attacks of migraine, topiramate is a first-line drug for migraine prevention in many countries; it is generally safe and reasonably well tolerated. Data suggest that topiramate could aid reversion of chronic migraine to episodic migraine.',\n",
              "  'Post-dural puncture headache: pathophysiology, prevention and treatment. Post-dural puncture headache (PDPHA) has been a vexing problem for patients undergoing dural puncture for spinal anaesthesia, as a complication of epidural anaesthesia, and after diagnostic lumbar puncture since Bier reported the first case in 1898. This Chapter discusses the pathophysiology of low-pressure headache resulting from leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid to the epidural spaces. Clinical and laboratory research over the last 30 years has shown that use of small-gauge needles, particularly of the pencil-point design, is associated with a lower risk of PDPHA than traditional cutting point needle tips (Quincke-point needles). A careful history can rule out other causes of headache. A positional component of headache is the sine qua non of PDPHA. In high-risk patients (e.g. age < 50 years, post-partum, large-gauge-needle puncture), patients should be offered early (within 24-48 h of dural puncture) epidural blood patch. The optimum volume of blood has been shown to be 12-20 ml for adult patients. Complications of autologous epidural blood patch are rare.',\n",
              "  'Positive and negative selection in murine ultraconserved noncoding elements. There are many more selectively constrained noncoding than coding nucleotides in the mammalian genome, but most mammalian noncoding DNA is subject to weak selection, on average. One of the most striking discoveries to have emerged from comparisons among mammalian genomes is the hundreds of noncoding elements of more than 200 bp in length that show absolute conservation among mammalian orders. These elements represent the tip of the iceberg of a much larger class of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). Much evidence suggests that CNEs are selectively constrained and not mutational cold-spots, and there is evidence that some CNEs play a role in the regulation of development. Here, we quantify negative and positive selection acting in murine CNEs by analyzing within-species nucleotide variation and between-species divergence of CNEs that we identified using a phylogenetically independent comparison. The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations in CNEs, inferred from within-species polymorphism, suggests that CNEs receive a higher number of strongly selected deleterious mutations and many fewer nearly neutral mutations than amino acid sites of protein-coding genes or regulatory elements close to genes. However, we also show that CNEs experience a far higher proportion of adaptive substitutions than any known category of genomic sites in murids. The absolute rate of adaptation of CNEs is similar to that of amino acid sites of proteins. This result suggests that there is widespread adaptation in mammalian conserved noncoding DNA elements, some of which have been implicated in the regulation of crucially important processes, including development.',\n",
              "  'Population pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes. Data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple oral dose studies of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; N = 974; 1-100 mg q.d.; < 12 weeks) were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for empagliflozin. The model consisted of two-compartmental disposition, lagged first-order absorption and first-order elimination, and incorporated appropriate covariates. Population estimates (interindividual variance, CV%) of oral apparent clearance, central and peripheral volumes of distribution, and inter-compartmental clearance were 9.87 L/h (26.9%), 3.02 L, 60.4 L (30.8%), and 5.16 L/h, respectively. An imposed allometric weight effect was the most influential PK covariate effect, with a maximum effect on exposure of ±30%, using 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of observed weights, relative to the median observed weight. Sex and race did not lend additional description to PK variability beyond allometric weight effects, other than ∼25% greater oral absorption rate constant for Asian patients. Age, total protein, and smoking/alcohol history did not affect PK parameters. Predictive check plots were consistent with observed data, implying an adequate description of empagliflozin PKs following multiple dosing in patients with T2DM. The lack of marked covariate effects, including weight, suggests that no exposure-based dose adjustments were required within the study population and dose range.',\n",
              "  'Regulation of DNMT1 stability through SET7-mediated lysine methylation in mammalian cells. Inheritance of epigenetic information encoded by cytosine DNA methylation patterns is crucial for mammalian cell survival, in large part through the activity of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). Here, we show that SET7, a known histone methyltransferase, is involved in the regulation of protein stability of DNMT1. SET7 colocalizes and directly interacts with DNMT1 and specifically monomethylates Lys-142 of DNMT1. Methylated DNMT1 peaks during the S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle and is prone to proteasome-mediated degradation. Overexpression of SET7 leads to decreased DNMT1 levels, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SET7 stabilizes DNMT1. These results demonstrate that signaling through SET7 represents a means of DNMT1 enzyme turnover.',\n",

S100A4 is a small calcium-binding protein that is commonly overexpressed in a range of different tumor types, and it is widely accepted that S100A4 has an important role in the process of cancer metastasis. In vitro binding assays has shown that S100A4 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, indicating that S100A4 may have additional roles in tumor development. In the present study, we show that endogenous S100A4 and p53 interact in complex samples, and that the interaction increases after inhibition of MDM2-dependent p53 degradation using Nutlin-3A. Further, using proximity ligation assay, we show that the interaction takes place in the cell nucleus. S100A4 knockdown experiments in two p53 wild-type cell lines, A549 and HeLa, resulted in stabilization of p53 protein, indicating that S100A4 is promoting p53 degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that S100A4 knockdown leads to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Thus, our data add a new layer to the oncogenic properties of S100A4 through its inhibition of p53-dependent processes.',\n",

PURPOSE: To examine the early impact of the Paediatric Regulation, which entered into force in Europe on 27 January 2007, on the development of pharmaceutical drugs in the therapeutic field of pain submitted to the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) and to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). METHODS: Paediatric Investigations Plans (PIPs) submitted with a Decision (outcome) reached between September 2007 and March 2010 were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 17 Paediatric Investigation Plans submitted, 14 have resulted in an EMA Decision, 3 were withdrawn by the applicants, 8 were granted a full waiver from development, and 1 resulted in a negative opinion. Decisions as issued included 15 clinical trials, with at least 1,282 children to be recruited into studies across five different products. Neonates were included in four of the products. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of submissions indicates a lack of new drugs being developed for the management of pain. Ethical concerns that too many vulnerable children will be recruited into clinical trials must be balanced against limiting the number of off-label prescribing and obtaining age-appropriate information on paediatric use. Now is an opportune time for clinicians, academics, learned societies and industry to collaborate for the benefit of children in pain.',\n",
